**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.","Short Answers to Simple Questions | July 10, 2019",2019-07-10 14:05:16

AskHistorians,DrKarenDempsey,0,259,"**Thanks very much for having me, I’ve got to stop answering questions and get back to writing an article about medieval gardens and women's daily life. It's been so much fun - I really had to think fast with all of your great questions. I wish I could answer everything!! I'm on twitter @karrycrow (but not always posting about medieval!!)**

&amp;#x200B;

I am Dr Karen Dempsey, a medieval  archaeologist based at the University of Reading where I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow - basically a post-doctoral researcher. My current project is called Herstory. It focuses on understanding medieval castles, from a feminist perspective....in other words telling inclusive stories of people living in castles beyond war, power (or horses!!). I am particularly interested in medieval women, my work includes studies of the things they used loved and care about as well as they places they lived - castles. I am also interested in eco-feminism, female devotional practice (in the garden - sowing seeds as prayers anyone??). I am also interested in how modern communities engage with material heritage especially in relation to castles.

AskHistorians,SavyRoma66,0,7,"I apologize in advance for the general question! Perhaps this might not even belong here, it might be more of a sociology question. I am not sure but I hope someone here can shed some light. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time: Before writing became commonplace

Place: I am going to assume that would be not as relevant as I expect the same principle to apply more or less universally.  I hope that is okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clarification: I am aware that over the many years oral traditions would change and alter but today I heard a claim (in the context of mythology and meta-stories) that over time, orally passed-down stories, specifically myth stories, were stripped down to their essense and any irrelevant details were dropped, leaving behind only the details which had a meaning. This seems to be counter-intuitive as I would have expected the exact opposite to happen: over time stories would become more and more embellished with each generation adding something to the story. Is it possible to make a general claim (i know, terrible) about the validity of this?

AskHistorians,SaturnineSasuke,0,1,"I am currently watching Hokuto No Ken, and in one incident the hero Kenshiro meets a farmer who raises chicken and sells eggs for a living. The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage when......

A bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.

In addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which ""Ninja Chefs"" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. 

The project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.

These two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.

The first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. 

And what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.

Hell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!

In addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:

""Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death"".

He explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.

Hell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.

I am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?

Can anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!

AskHistorians,Junkererer,0,3,"I have some questions about this topic. First of all, I heard that becoming a knight required years of training starting during the childhood as a page and then as a squire. Knights are usually imagined as mounted soldiers but *knight* was a nobiliary title as well. Did these two definitions always coincide or were there noble knights who didn't train to fight on horses or even fight at all? (or expected to be able to do it at least)

On the opposite, were there ""heavy horsemen"" who weren't formally knights?

Did all the nobles fight on horses or were there nobles fighting on foot or even using ranged weapons? Did this depend on the rank and on the wealth of the noble?

Were all the knights people who completed that special training or could other people be knighted on special occasions as well such as due to a good performance in battle or similar situations?

How often were new knights appointed? Was there one big event during which several new knights were appointed or was there a ceremony for each individual case or does it depend? Was this done by kings, dukes, counts, barons, by all lords independently of the rank or does it depend?

Do we have historical records about how many knights there were in a certain kingdom at any period during the Middle Ages approximately? (this is a quite broad question, I don't care about a specific place or a specific period)

Were all the male children of a noble couple initiated to the knight training of just some of them depending on the type of education the parents wanted for those children?

Are knight-errant's just fictional idealized figures or did something similar really exist?

Was it possible for a lowborn to ever become a knight, or even just a page/squire as a lowborn kid? If yes, how likely was it? Do we have any historical record of this?

Same thing for women, were there women who became knights? Same as above, do we have any historical record of this?

I know about Joan of Arc who was both a woman and a lowborn and she fought on battlefields but that seems like an extremely exceptional case, but I don't know much about her to be honest

I may have said wrong stuff so correct me in that case. I'm sorry if my use of the word knight is a bit misleading, in my language horseman and knight are often used as synonyms so I may use the word knight incorrectly sometimes.

While I've seen [this very comprehensive post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7wwo7w/how_long_was_the_average_basic_training_for_a/) that goes into basic training for what appears to be infantry, how officers become officers if they are not field promoted is a bit confusing

&amp;#x200B;

Let's pretend someone is drafted and is immediately identified as a great candidate for OCS due to having taken a bunch of calculus and a smattering of german. (or you can make up a better reason.  Either way, my fake guy is going to OCS)

&amp;#x200B;

So he's sent to OCS - when exactly does he show up to OCS in the whole long schedule after his draft number is called (after basic's 13 weeks?)

&amp;#x200B;

Now he's at OCS - and while I understand that there are some significant differences in some of the classroom aspects of the different OCS programs due to the nature of the corps in charges (like the navy is not teaching about radar theory) - what exactly was being taught?  What was the program like outside of the classroom?  How did it work? What were they doing during their 90 days? How did one flunk out?   How effective of a program was this compared to officer training (or lack thereof) in the interwar years?

let's pretend you're an MD - do they even send you to boot camp? or do they just commission you?  or do you go through OCS?  How similar is an MD's story about becoming an officer to other highly educated groups the militry needed as support staff - Eg Let's pretend you have a masters degree in radio wave theory - are you just snapped up, commissioned, and sent to California - or do they make you do basic and OCS too? - and for someone like an MD or our fake masters degree student Are there conditions where the Military would still want to put you closer to the front lines, like say triage or handling battalion radio, even as an officer, even though you might also do well much further back as support in say a big hospital or a big radar station - and how does this affect the training schedule","What was officer's training in ww2 for an american like, especially once they got to an OCS?

AskHistorians,LondonSeoul,0,1,"I was recently reading Simon Jenkin's 'A short history of England' and he included Oppenheimer's theory on Anglo-Saxon settlement as a possible explanation for the Anglo-Saxon presence in Britain. In a nutshell, Oppenheimer (read [here](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/mythsofbritishancestry)) not only supports the view that there was no large-scale or genocidal invasion of Britain by Anglo-Saxons. He actually goes further to argue that not only was the Anglo-Saxon 'invasion' much smaller than historians once claimed but that much of the British Isles was already settled by Germanic peoples.

&gt;The orthodox view is that the entire population of the British Isles, including England, was Celtic-speaking when Caesar invaded. But if that were the case, a modest Anglo-Saxon invasion is unlikely to have swept away all traces of Celtic language from the pre-existing population of England. Yet there are only half a dozen Celtic words in English, the rest being mainly Germanic, Norman or medieval Latin. One explanation is that England was not mainly Celtic-speaking before the Anglo-Saxons. Consider, for example, the near-total absence of Celtic inscriptions in England (outside Cornwall), although they are abundant in Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Brittany.

He goes onto argue that at the time of the Roman invasion, much of southern Britain was inhabited by Belgic peoples speaking non-Celtic tongues:

&gt;In other words, a Germanic-type language could already have been indigenous to England at the time of the Roman invasion.

Oppenheimer claims that the English language could have developed much earlier than currently recognised as a ""fourth branch of the Germanic language before the Roman invasion."" The Anglo-Saxon settlers thus moved into a land already culturally familiar rather than wholly foreign:

&gt;A picture thus emerges of the dark-ages invasions of England and northeastern Britain as less like replacements than minority elite additions, akin to earlier and larger Neolithic intrusions from the same places. There were battles for dominance between chieftains, all of Germanic origin, each invader sharing much culturally with their newly conquered indigenous subjects. 

Question: Has any evidence been found in the last decade or so to support Oppenheimer's claims? Does any of this hold water according to current archaeological and linguistic research? I was surprised to see Simon Jenkins include the theory as a possibility in his 2011 book so I wondered how seriously the claims are still taken.

AskHistorians,NeilBreault,0,3,"I am doing some research for myself for a potential upcoming novel I want to write and part of the story revolves around a gun. Form my basic research so far I have found gunpowder was invented around the 9th century in China and didn't enter in to warfare until 1000 AD. Go wikipedia. 

Now, what I have not been able to find but know there should be some answers to, is what where the limitations of various civilizations from them being utilized for guns? Research? Imagination? Metallurgy? Not broke don't fix it(warfare)?

From gunpowder there are many weapons that have arisen and culminated in cannons before hand held weapons. I can surmise the cannon worked because of the sheer amount of metal to house the explosion and am guessing the thinner metals would have exploded. I guess my question boils down to why? 

Now, as this is going to be in a novel, I can skip a lot of intervening time but don't want to hand wave something that I can adequately explain. Right now I don't know if I am in the right ball park or if I need to think about this from a different angle.

To the basic question, if dealing with China, why did they not have guns in 1000 AD? Why did it take until the 1500's (?) for Europe to have firearms? (I think that date is off) Why were blackpowder weapons so prevalent and why did it take so long for cartridge and bullet style guns to be the norm.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to get some idea on how much of a population moved around seasonally, for whatever reasons, versus the amount that stayed where they were at whatever job they had. I am setting aside the issues of 'is it legal for these peasants to leave the farm' because those vary wildly and an estate was often large enough to include small towns with 'urban jobs' so I figure that didn't require as serious a permission slip from your local landowning tyrant.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically, I'm curious what portion of a given population might venture back from cities and towns, where they might have 'industrial modern' jobs, in order to labor for important seasonal tasks, such as harvesting and planting. I do know that farm hands were paid some kind of wage above room and board, and that itself was good enough to be worth it over starving certainly, but is it worth losing a job you have currently?

&amp;#x200B;

Industrial age jobs were... *scant* on job security, so I cannot imagine that anyone leaving an industrial labor job had an expectation that it would just be there for them when they got back. So I would assume that this kind of seasonal labor flow was only among the most precarious laborers, and the ones with the fewest prospects.",What was the impact of Seasonal Labor Demands during the Industrial Revolution Eras?,2019-07-08 23:42:03

This is rarely the case, and the institutions of imperial Germany militated against it.”

AskHistorians,hyperviolator,0,1,"I'm not overly familiar with the history around this, and to be honest the idea may be a wholesale invention of a particular modern writer. I'm not sure, so hence the question.

Basically, the writer Neil Gaiman, famous for things like American Gods, The Sandman, Coraline, Stardust, Good Omens (with Terry Pratchet), and the version of Lucifer in the TV show running now, has a very paricular notion of the afterlife that winds through much of his work:

**You live, and then you die. Upon your death, your ultimate fate is *your* decision.**

Do you believe you're very guilty, and very bad, even down to your unconscious? What's your heart believe? If you think you ought to be tortured in hell -- because that's what you believe is your fate -- your soul is wandering into hell and *will* be tortured. If you believe your fate is to ride off to Valhalla and drink beer with the mythological Thor all day and throw hammers, you're going to be drunk for eternity and throw metal around. That's basically it, but humans just don't 'get' it outside a handful of times ever. If you're in hell, and you believe you've reformed, or even if you just want a vacation, you can trivially walk right out and nothing can force you to stay (but the powers-that-be can still shove you around somewhat, because they're gods and all). The idea is *we* decide, though we don't know it. 

There's a darkly funny moment in one story in Sandman (which becomes the beginning of the Lucifer stories/series) where one day, the Devil decides he's done and basically doesn't need this shit anymore, so he kicks *everyone* out of hell, locks the door, and hands off the key. He wants to live on Earth and just be himself for a good long while. In the process of doing that, he finds one last human soul, chained to a big rock, splayed open in agony and torture. The Devil tells the guy, basically, ""Get out, we're closing,"" and the guy starts ranting about all the terrible things he did a thousand years ago, torture, murder, rape, you name it, he's done it. ""I gotta get punished more! I was AWFUL!"" is his eternal thing. The Devil is like, talk to the hand, and throws him out of hell.

Is there anything historical along these lines, where the human soul makes the call for its final disposition?","Is there any historical background in religion for the notion in certain works of fiction that the deceased make a decision, conscious or unconscious, to choose their own afterlife?",2019-07-08 20:26:52

His intent was apparently to make it to Franco's Spain, so why not just go there?

The readings I've done seem to indicate [his diaries](https://archive.org/stream/GibsonHughTheCianoDiaries19391943TheCompleteUnabridgedDiariesOfCountGaleazzoCian/Gibson%2C+Hugh+-+The+Ciano+Diaries+1939-1943+The+Complete%2C+Unabridged+Diaries+of+Count+Galeazzo+Ciano%2C+Italian+Minister+of+Foreign+Affairs%2C+1936-1943_djvu.txt) were known of and of some importance to many in Nazi intelligence and foreign ministries and that he tried to barter these for safe passage to Spain, which was then to be Hungary, because Ernst Kaltenbrunner didn't want such a high profile person to escape the confines of the Axis powers. 

And in good faith, Ciano told the Germans where some of the diary entries were and they found them and according to Wilhelm Höttl, ""afforded ample proof of the immense value which the complete collection would be.""

Regardless, there seems to have been enough debate in Nazi circles about what to do with Ciano. Some wanted to free him, some wanted to turn him over to the puppet state, the Italian Socialist Republic, now that Mussolini had been rescued and ""restored.""

But he was turned over, faced a [show trial at Verona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_trial) and was executed in January of 1944.

Some of what I've seen is that though the order came from Mussolini himself, since Ciano was one of the votes of no-confidence against Mussolini in July of 1943.  But apparently there was also lot of pressure from higher ups in Nazi Germany to kill Ciano.

So to get back to my original question ... why did Count Ciano think it was a good idea to ""escape"" to Nazi Germany after the fall of the Fascist regime in July of 1943?

AskHistorians,sammyjamez,0,6,"This thought has been in the back of my mind for quite a while due to the fact that throughout my time learning about history, I learned that things were not always what they seemed to be or were not how I was taught long ago like how Columbus never actually set foot on American soil and his reverence as an American hero came much later after the foundation of America as a nation (and it was done by Italian immigrants, not Americans), or how the stories of Nero during the great fire of Rome were probably exaggerated and sensationalist remarks of the tyrant that he was during that time to picture him in a bad image, or how I learned that the Greco-Persian war and the Peloponnesian War were not that black and white as I was told before, or how I once taught that the Roman Enpire actually ended after the fall of Rome during the 4th Century but actually still existed as the Byzantine Empire (at least the historians call it that because the Byzantines still called themselves Romans) till the 15th Century. 

All of these were either the results of misinformation (whether intentional or not; possible bias or perhaps propaganda (like Herodotus, the father of history, is also known as the father of lies (at least, that was what he was known for at a time) becuase at was later found in the Histories, some connotations were either false or make-believe); or where some facts or evidence were re-arranged in a manner that people viewed as what was fit for them or how they saw it (like The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon where he glorified the legacies and the actions that the Western Roman Empire left behind that impacted Europe but completely neglected the Byzantine Empire); or where there are historical information that you find in plenty of books, articles and websites and are treated as fact or valid but later investigations or later insight of other perspectives of a certain event with say otherwise (like for example, there is a online comic that depicts as Nikola Tesla as a greatest and misunderstood genius who ever lived. I even believed that too until I encountered a detailed article (I think it was on reddit as well, I cannot remember) that debunked the whole article and treated it as rhetoric. Or another example is when later investigations found that the pyramids were probably built by paid workers, not by slaves)

Sometimes perceptions of historical events have influenced other areas like works of art like the story of Nazi Germany and WW2 have influenced the moulding of the archetype of the crazy army and fanatical dictator stereotype that wants to conquer the world for the sake of world domination or fanaticism regardless of the history that led to it or the factors that influenced in the background that led to it. Or how current perceptions of history can influence how we view historical events from the current 21st century perspective which can hinder us from fully understanding how it was at that time like for example our views towards imperialism vs how imperialism was practiced beforehand and why;, or how certain civilisations get more attention over others (this is something that puzzles me actually) while the others are neglected and their legacies and influences are hindered from being recognised, explored or even given the attention for whatever secrets they may hold (like for example Damascus steel or the Nazca lines of Peru)

There are plenty of people involved here - historians who have to examine the perspectives of the people who wrote these histories, whether it is from other books, letters, drawings, diaries and so on; then you have the people themselves who even wrote these stories in the beginning which could differ in context, description, accuracy or exaggeration; then you have the authors of the history books, the academic articles, the websites and the forums online, and then you have the teachers and the students who learn and teach what they know and spread the message along. 

So obviously, then it comes to histography and passing those histories along, there is a possibility that errors might come up, perhaps a person understood the story in a different way, or when passing the story by word of mouth could lead ommission/addition/change of certain details, translations from different languages can lead to possible inaccurate mistranslations as different language may not have the exact word of every word from another language or certain words or phrases could interpreted differently, and so on and so forth. 

It sounds like a big thought where I am probably jumping to conclusions without knowing the answers but it is something that makes me think and sometimes even worry when misinformation is spread around treated as valid or factual","When it comes to histography and historicity, how can historians, authors and even the readers of the histories be aware of the accuracy of the histories that they read and write?",2019-07-08 18:18:04

For example:

-The refusal of the Conventionists to accept Carranza as president under any circumstances, including Pancho Villa who doesn’t seem to have been especially driven by ideology.

-Calles’ support of Obregón despite Carranza bringing Calles into his cabinet.

-Seemingly the entire country immediately turning against Carranza the moment the split between him and Obregón became apparent.

While it does seem that Carranza favored a strong central government and executive more than his opponents, was somewhat less enthusiastic about radical land reform than many of them, and had worryingly bad relations with the United States, these factors don’t seem like enough by themselves to justify years of continued struggle, economic damage, and loss of life in an already war-weary nation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Yes, but there must be something specific about Cupid that made him different than other ancient figures of love like Aphrodite. Why didn't Aphrodite become a figure of Heavenly and Earthly love in the middle ages?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Offhand, my first gut guess is ""well, Augustus has a cupid by his knees in Prima Porta just to show the emperor's divinity-- so perhaps putting cupids near figures didn't carry the stigma of cupid being a full blown pagan God that needed to be damned?""

&amp;#x200B;

And my second guess is that cupid looks a bit like angels, so perhaps he translated better into the Christian world of the middle ages than other ancient Greek entities? Weren't many of the pagan statues destroyed / seen as false gods  in iconoclasm? 

&amp;#x200B;

And my only other guess was that maybe is he just cute and small- and that's why he remained popular? Then again, alot of medieval depictions of cupid in books do not portray him as cute- they often give him the face of an old man and adult proportions sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So what is the real answer why Cupid was spared from the damnation/fall in popularity that other pagan figures went through? (if we assume Cupid did originate from Eros)**","If Cupid originates from the ancient Greek Eros, why did Cupid remain so popular in art in the middle ages despites being a pagan in origin? What made him different than other figures from Greek mythology that he survived the iconoclasm and the drop in popularity of other Greek mythology figures?",2019-07-08 00:12:44

AskHistorians,chevalier-sans-peur,0,1,"I've recently completed  a uni module on late medieval and early Tudor English history, and one of the topics I explored is popular rebellions and there's a noticeable pattern with them which goes like this - a tradition of popular revolt emerges in the late 14th century with the so-called ""peasants"" revolts in the Home Counties and East Anglia in 1381, reaches maturity in the 1450s with Jack Cade's rebellion in 1450, which attracts support from everyone from gentry down to labourers and is done in the name of the ""commonweal"" (essentially meaning public good/ national interest, and then peaks in the early Tudor period (1485 - 1553) in which there are 7 rebellions which could be called popular (one in 1489, another in 1497, another still in 1525, two in 1536 and finally another two in 1549) before dying out altogether thereafter. I'm not very familiar with the literature on the decline of popular rebellions - my module stopped quite abruptly at 1550 after all - but on a BBC in our time podcast I heard the eminent Tudor historian John Guy argue that it was a result of changes in the social order, or at least perceptions of it. According to him, whilst in 1501 the traditional ideal of a society of orders (priests, knights and labourers all performing their distinctive functions and mutually supporting each other) still held some sway, by 1600 you have the beginnings of a class system of haves and have nots with the propertied and politically enfranchised people (in the case of rural society everyone from prosperous yeomen farmers up) almost invariably siding with the state against the rabble, and the poor having recourse to nothing but localised rioting about single issues (food prices, enclosure etc). I've also briefly read Michael Bush and Andy Wood suggesting similar things.

3-how did ancient Irish communities, tribes, or petty kingdoms interact with each other and how prevalent was interaction across the Irish sea and beyond. What resources did Irish societies export and import (IE trade) and with whom? 


4-how was information transferred in ancient Ireland? Was there a writing system, and if so, what was used to write upon? How were myths, legends and information passed down among the generations? 


5-how did culture and religion, as well as their associates practices, differ among the four provinces of Ireland (Ulster, Connacht, Munster, Leinster ), and how severe were these differences? 


6-how was war in ancient Ireland fought... what weapons and tactics were used, were there any customs or traditions that were carried out before or after a battle?

AskHistorians,RedSheepCole,0,1,"I vaguely remember reading, in high school history, that the nuclear family (defined as two parents and their children forming a household by themselves) was a post-WWII innovation, and that previously extended was the norm.  I believe the claim was specifically for the US, but a lot of people I talk to have the general idea that people in past societies tended to form big extended clans all living together.  Note that I am speaking specifically of household arrangements, not the social power of extended kin networks or anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

However, what I've been able to find on the subject paints a different picture.  Gies's *Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages* says that nuclear was the highly desired norm in Western Europe, if not always achieved, while my *Oxford History of Byzantium* bluntly states that nuclear was the basic family unit in the East.  Old books like the Little House series appear to depict nuclear households, albeit the extended family plays a stronger role than is typical today.  Jesus's line about a man leaving father and mother implies that, if ancient Jews had extended households, they formed around the bride's parents.

&amp;#x200B;

AskHistorians,Dr_Aradius,0,1,"Hi! I have a few questions for the liturgical history aficionados here. As far as I understand the development of Christian liturgy in Late Antique Egypt, the entire Patriarchate of Alexandria in the 5th century would have been using an old form of the Coptic liturgical tradition. When the See of Alexandria rejected the Council, forming the Coptic Orthodox Church, it continued  on with its normal liturgical tradition.

What  about the pro-Chalcedon party in Egypt? Was it initially liturgically Coptic, but became Byzantine over time as result of expected Byzantine  theological (and therefore theological) influence? Or was it perhaps  immediately served by Greek/Byzantine priests? Were there official  Imperial orders that would create a policy of Byzantinization of pro-Chalcedonian communities in Egypt? Do we know how long did the  situation take to settle, how long did the transformation take?

I  understand that the differences between regional liturgical traditions  were not as starkly visible in that period (it took a few more centuries  and a few more controversies along the way), so maybe liturgical transitions weren't that big of a deal in the immediate aftermath of Chalcedon. But I would guess that it didn't take very long either for the Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian parties in Egypt to assert their  theological differences by asserting linguistic and liturgical  differences.

I guess another way of  putting my question would be: how long did it take for the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria to look and sound very unlike the  Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria?",Coptic liturgy vs Byzantine liturgy in Egypt after Chalcedon,2019-07-05 16:47:53

I saw a (very) modern version of it a few days ago - and thought the Regisseur had butchered it - but even after reading up on the original I found it hard to contextualise.

-  What was the ""working man's"" situation? And what was Stanley Kowalskis appeal?

Was it a ""yeah, we'll show those fragile aristocrats what life's like""? Was it him symbolising the ""new, up and coming america"" (of the worker?) ? He served in WW2, has a hard labour job as a mechanic, provides for his family etc? Was him raping Blanche and beating his wife an ""acceptable flaw""?

If wikipedia is to be trusted even Tennessee Williams - after being asked about the plays meaning - said ""You better watch out or the apes take over!"" which seems to rather harshly criticize the uneducated/raw/primitive elements of the working class?

- What did the ""(southern) aristocracy"" think of it and/or the ""new america"" in general? I'm not too familiar with questions like ""who watched broadway plays in the 50s"", maybe it was a lot less ""upper class"" than I imagine it to be.

- How did women react to it?

I'll ignore Blanche here to keep it brief, as Stella/women of the working class family are my main focus.

Stella puts up with her husband beating her and even raping her sister (which she doesnt believe)/sending her to a mental institution. Was her stepping out of her aristocratic upbringing and into ""the real world"" + accepting her husband with all his flaws seen as empowering in some way? Women's empowerment/liberation was still lacking in '47 (Stanley served in WW2, but it's unclear if Stella did work?), was her role in the family seen as positive? Was sex/physical love as central in a 50s relationship as the play depicts it?

AskHistorians,huzurarayan,0,2,"This question emerged from my reading on early modern sexuality and law. I'm wondering how the concept of rape was understood by Europeans of this time period (c. 1300-1600). Nowadays we have a definition of the term tied very closely to the concept of consent. But as far as I understand it this wasn't the case in Europe during the period in question. For example, I've read that spousal rape was not recognized as such, and that prostitutes in some cities could not legally be raped, as they were regarded as belonging to the community. Clearly, consent was not necessarily the main factor that went into determining what was and wasn't rape. So how was rape actually defined? What language was used to refer to it (presumably this varies by region)? Was the concept contingent upon the law - i.e. in the case of the above-mentioned prostitutes, would acts of violence against them be thought of as ""legal rape"" or would they, because they were legal, not be defined as rape at all? What, if anything, was ""consent"" understood to be?

Here's the question:

Alot of cultures which Christianity has taken over, very little history is left of those cultures, Finnish are rather expectional of having still strong oral traditional remnants of our old beliefs. Question is though, how were the Finnish pagans treated around the time the crusades came? 

I've read something about the Swedish Pope Gregorius IX complaining about Gotland selling horses to Finnish pagans, which was around 1299. I'm not talking about the few remaining and mostly having normal rights type of pagans around past 1400-1500, even if they faced some discrimination still. I mean were alot of them killed, tortured, etc. Past the time of crusades?


Notes:
This question can seem nationalistic, however I believe alot of our culture and such have come from here, rather than Sweden (They have played a role in it though and the people from there have brought our older culture back or contributed to it, which I appreciate). I'm not speaking as if we had a great kingdom, however I personally find excusing our culture always to being Swedish rather unproductive.

AskHistorians,Wastelander108,0,2,"In Western Media we often see the average Soviet soldier as severely under trained, under supplied, and just generally not at all bright. So a couple of questions regarding such:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What is the extent of Soviet training? We usually see a truck full of fresh recruits unloaded about  300 feet or so from the front line where they undergo very brief training on the basics of using a rifle and that is it before they run straight to the battlefield. Was there no basic training? Was there no military organization into Companies, Squads, Fire Teams, ect.? Or was this a rare event that happened in desperation (such as the Siege of Stalingrad) and then has just been portrayed as being the norm throughout the entire war?
2. Were Soviet troops really that under supplied? A somewhat famous quote from a popular video game goes something along the lines of: ""One man gets bullets, the other man gets a rifle! When the man with the rifle dies, the man with the bullets picks up the rifle!"" Did the Soviet Union really not have enough weapons to supply the army? I personally find that hard to believe considering there are literally millions of authentic Mosin Nagant rifles still in circulation today, some even unused. Furthermore if they really did not have enough weapons for the whole military did they honestly just send unarmed soldiers out to die instead of putting them to work in a logistics unit or something instead where they can still do something to benefit the army without needing a weapon?
3. Now, onto the infamous suicide charge. We have all seen it, hundreds of men bravely charging across an open area towards a fortified position at the sound of a whistle blow, only to be cut down by machine gun fire with no survivors. Was this a legitimate Soviet tactic? Did commanders really throw hundreds of lives away with a single charge with no real plan in mind other than ""Get over there and kill the enemy!""? Or again is this just a case of it happening maybe once or twice and it being turned into a stereotype and generalized as being a constant thing that happened throughout the war?

As a Kurd I think majority of Kurds are convinced that the Medes are their ancestors but majority of historian reject that claim, this made me to search a little bit about this topic.

Lately I've found some Syriac Aramic sources that kept mentioning the Medes as a people till Islamic invasions, even in Bible the Medes aren't extinct people as mentioned in **Acts 2: 8-11** *Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native
language?  Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia*

* Isaac complex in 410 AD mentioned Diocese of the Medes.

+ Aqaq complex in 486 AD mentioned **Abraham the Med**. It's believed name of the town of **Batnaya** in Nineveh plain came from **Beth Madaya** which means **home of the Medes**.

- Babi complex in 497 AD mentioned Median bishop.

* Grigor Complex in 605 AD mentioned Median bishop.

+ Joseph complex in 554 AD mentioned that Aqaq is Bishop of the Medes.

- And finally **Tertullian** an early Christian author in 2nd century mentioned that **The Medes** are believer of **Jesus**.


I have more sources that mentioned The Medes, mostly mentioned them in the geography that Kurds live in today, another confusion thing all these Syriac sources above have mentioned Kurds too, so The Medes and the Kurds were living at same time, a Kurdish historian Soran Hamarash believes that The Medes were elite ruling family of the empire, so even after the fall of their empire they kept ruling small kingdoms for centuries later, it's just like today as we mention Ottomans but in fact Ottomans were only elite ruling family and the rest of people were Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs.. etc.

I want to know why they kept mentioning the Medes although their empire fall centuries ago, did the Medes survived or they just referred everyone who lived in Ancient Media as Median?

Thursday Reading and Recommendations is intended as bookish free-for-all, for the discussion and recommendation of all books historical, or tangentially so. Suggested topics include, but are by no means limited to:

 * Asking for book recommendations on specific topics or periods of history
 
 * Newly published books and articles you're dying to read

 * Recent book releases, old book reviews, reading recommendations, or just talking about what you're reading now

 * Historiographical discussions, debates, and disputes
 
 * ...And so on!

Regular participants in the Thursday threads should just keep doing what they've been doing; newcomers should take notice that this thread is meant for open discussion of history and books, not just anything you like -- we'll have a thread on Friday for that, as usual.","Thursday Reading &amp; Recommendations | July 04, 2019",2019-07-04 14:05:02

1. When did the king actually get his hands on the Declaration of Independace? (Or copy of), and was this his first time seeing/hearing about it?

2. Was the King really the person that needed to see it, or was Parliament/a colonial governor the real intended recipient of the Declaration of Independance?

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

I ask this because in Indonesia there is a particular strain of Islam called 'Islam Nusantara' that in short has adapted Islamic practices with the local culture, especially Javanese culture, and lately has been somewhat declining in favour of practices more similar to those found in Arab countries (stricter covering, less tolerance of other religions and more militant) due to an increased number of imams being trained in Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

He'd said many times that the only thing evil on God's Earth were communists.  I also remember him saying he can meet his Maker with a clear conscience because he never cheated on his wife with a woman more attractive than her, and he never harmed his fellow man, only communists.

After the wars, he became an engineering professor in the 60's and 70's.  He told me of his colleagues who had a plan to turn the US socialist.  It had three parts.

Part 1 was to encourage massive amounts of people to get welfare benefits.

Part 2 was for the government to become bankrupt from paying for welfare benefits for such a large amount of people.

Part 3 was for the masses who now could not provide for themselves to overthrow the current US government in favor for a social welfare state which would be run by these academics.

My uncle told me more details of this plan, such as encouraging migration to the US by offering migrants generous social services hence increasing the masses dependent on the state, advocating for universal basic income, and creating a divide among the mostly white middle class (paying taxes) and minority populations in the US (consuming social services in this case).

AskHistorians,camilo16,0,2,"So I have become interested in the history of the Mali empire, and know little about it. I was surprised learning that it was one of the richest empires in history, yet had many buildings made with mud, although it also had buildings made with stone and other materials.

Without much knowledge these are the potential explanations I came up with:

1. Heat: Stone and even wood probably are good at retaining heat, which in an equatorial region could make living quarters an oven without some additional engineering. On the other hand, mud allowed for better heat transmission from the inside towards the outside, making mud a more desirable material for building.
2. Unnavailability of materials: Maybe wood and stone were not abundant in the region and were a hassle to transport. Why bother moving tonnes of stone when you have a perfectly good and maleable construction material right next to you.
3. Lack of military incentive to use stone and other sturdier materials: In europe, it was usually just town walls and castles that were made of stone (with the exception of cathedrals), because they served a military purpose. The rest of the constructions (houses, storage...) where often made of a combination of other materials like cow dung, timber, mud... Depending on the military situation of the Mali empire (number of enemies and whatnot) there would have been little economic incentive to build constructions in stone over mud.
4. Religious/cultural: Maybe they liked the way mud looks more than other materials, kind of like ""Our father's and the father's of our father's built this way and we are not here to break traditions"".
5. I am actually uniformed about the prevalence of mud based architecture in the Mali empire and as a matter of fact each construction was made of solid gold and the Mali empire is, in fact, El Dorado.

Am I right about any of these? I would like to be educated on the subject.","Why did the Mali empire, being one of the, if not the richest empire of its time use mud for so many of its constructions?",2019-07-04 00:50:27

AskHistorians,pedro3131,0,4,"Got in a debate with one of my friends who lives down in South Carolina and he posed a theory I had never heard before. I'll post his abridged comments (he's got some long windup about educating some ungrateful millennial which I'll chop out) down below but the Crux of his comment was that we only celebrate July 4th because of a military victory in South Carolina.

Now I've done some light reading on the topic (McCullough, Phillips, Bunker, Ellis, as well as a good deal of Jefferson and Adams letters) but I'd never heard this before. I can accept that maybe this victory influenced the South Carolina delegation (even then I'm not sure, as being from PA all my education focused around Dickinson and Morris) but is there any greater truth there?

""I asked this gentleman if he had any idea why we celebrate the 4th. I reminded him that the Battle of Sullivan's Island was a decisive victory over the Bittish Royal Navy that not only secured Charleston Harbor from the invading Brittish but it sent them high tailing their Navy to New York. SC delegates rode to Philadelphia and informed our founding fathers of this victory and they struck, declared independence from England as a result of this great victory. (Keep in mind that Charleston was one of the richest ports of the day) Certainly, we would be celebrating our independence but it may have been a completely different date had it not been for this South Carolina victory.

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.","Short Answers to Simple Questions | July 10, 2019",2019-07-10 14:05:16

I am Dr Karen Dempsey, a medieval  archaeologist based at the University of Reading where I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow - basically a post-doctoral researcher. My current project is called Herstory. It focuses on understanding medieval castles, from a feminist perspective....in other words telling inclusive stories of people living in castles beyond war, power (or horses!!). I am particularly interested in medieval women, my work includes studies of the things they used loved and care about as well as they places they lived - castles. I am also interested in eco-feminism, female devotional practice (in the garden - sowing seeds as prayers anyone??). I am also interested in how modern communities engage with material heritage especially in relation to castles.

Clarification: I am aware that over the many years oral traditions would change and alter but today I heard a claim (in the context of mythology and meta-stories) that over time, orally passed-down stories, specifically myth stories, were stripped down to their essense and any irrelevant details were dropped, leaving behind only the details which had a meaning.

AskHistorians,SaturnineSasuke,0,1,"I am currently watching Hokuto No Ken, and in one incident the hero Kenshiro meets a farmer who raises chicken and sells eggs for a living. The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage when......

A bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.

In addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which ""Ninja Chefs"" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. 

The project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.

These two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.

The first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. 

And what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.

Hell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!

In addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:

""Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death"".

He explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.

Hell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.

I am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?

Can anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!

AskHistorians,RickleTickle69,0,1,"It's the early 20th century. Great Britain is the world's biggest economic power and has an unrivalled colonial empire which gives it major advantages in global geopolitics and trade. Come the 1950's, this is no longer the case and the United States of America have already come out on top on the global scale.

I remember learning in history class about the cost of the two world wars on Great Britain and how that contributed to the independence of many former British colonies once Britain could no longer afford to run the administration and military occupation of those countries. I also remember learning about how New York started to gain more financial power than London in the 1920's and how the Marshall Plan came into effect in 1949, effectively taking away some of the economic leverage of Great Britain and gaining economic leverage for the United States on much of Western Europe through debt. Is it reasonable to say then that it was mostly (like 80%) the two world wars that led to Britain losing its unrivalled global position to other powers or are there other factors at play? Also, is it reasonable to say that Britain is such a close ally of the United States because of the debt incurred to them after the Marshall Plan?

AskHistorians,hamiltonkg,0,3,"The central hypothesis of *The City of God* by Augustine of Hippo is that the Christianization of Rome **did not** contribute to its decline, but in fact bought a nation already on the precipice of collapse a bit of borrowed time. The book was written in response to contemporaneous fifth century accusations of the exist opposite: that the Christianization of Rome **directly** contributed to its decline and overwhelming by various Goth tribes.

I've only really been able to find contemporary sources like [Ryan Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrI5U0R293u9uveijefKyAA) who explicitly comment on the veracity of this claim, but I think his perspective as a Christian apologist and theologian makes his observations a bit biased (though not necessarily wrong).

I've not really been able to find any legitimate or truly scholarly sources that have anything to say other than the acknowledgement that the spread of Christianity occurred during the decline of the Roman Empire so it raises the question: **Did the Christianization of Rome directly contribute to decline of the Roman Empire or was it merely happenstance that it occurred during the same period of time?**

I'm aware that many Romans viewed growing Roman inability to fend off the Goths as some kind of punishment for abandoning paganism, but my question is less about what people thought at the time, and more about how historians view these events 1,500 years later.

AskHistorians,Junkererer,0,3,"I have some questions about this topic. First of all, I heard that becoming a knight required years of training starting during the childhood as a page and then as a squire. Knights are usually imagined as mounted soldiers but *knight* was a nobiliary title as well. Did these two definitions always coincide or were there noble knights who didn't train to fight on horses or even fight at all? (or expected to be able to do it at least)

On the opposite, were there ""heavy horsemen"" who weren't formally knights?

Did all the nobles fight on horses or were there nobles fighting on foot or even using ranged weapons? Did this depend on the rank and on the wealth of the noble?

Were all the knights people who completed that special training or could other people be knighted on special occasions as well such as due to a good performance in battle or similar situations?

How often were new knights appointed? Was there one big event during which several new knights were appointed or was there a ceremony for each individual case or does it depend? Was this done by kings, dukes, counts, barons, by all lords independently of the rank or does it depend?

Do we have historical records about how many knights there were in a certain kingdom at any period during the Middle Ages approximately? (this is a quite broad question, I don't care about a specific place or a specific period)

Were all the male children of a noble couple initiated to the knight training of just some of them depending on the type of education the parents wanted for those children?

Are knight-errant's just fictional idealized figures or did something similar really exist?

Was it possible for a lowborn to ever become a knight, or even just a page/squire as a lowborn kid? If yes, how likely was it? Do we have any historical record of this?

Same thing for women, were there women who became knights? Same as above, do we have any historical record of this?

I know about Joan of Arc who was both a woman and a lowborn and she fought on battlefields but that seems like an extremely exceptional case, but I don't know much about her to be honest

So he's sent to OCS - when exactly does he show up to OCS in the whole long schedule after his draft number is called (after basic's 13 weeks?)

&amp;#x200B;

What was the program like outside of the classroom?  How did it work? What were they doing during their 90 days? How did one flunk out?

I am starting some research for a fun project and I was wondering if you lovely folks would be able to point me in the direction of good information or resources. I’ll just lay all my cards on the table and if someone steals my idea I can be the old guy in the bar saying that was my idea. But I’m not too worried about that. 

Basically, I am going to write a Scooby-Doo for my own enjoyment and I am going to make it my dream Scooby-Doo movie. I want it set when the show first originally aired and that is Sept. 13, 1969. Back in the “good ol days”.

I like the idea of setting it in the past and seeing how much things are different or the same, yadda yadda, plus I just think it would be fun. 

I have questions about some basic things and some specific things. 

How involved in Vietnam was the average HS student? Did they talk about it? Did boys worry if they did not go to college would they be drafted? Did they protest? Did the support? Was it all of the above?

Some more mundane everyday things. 

How did boys talk about girls? How did girls flirt? What did it sound like? What swear words where they using? How strict were parents? How did adults look at kids? How did kids look at adults? What was the hit movie? What was the hit song? What was the dumb song? Who was the joke of the day?

I hope this rambling gives you an idea of what I am looking for. I want to be able to write about these kids like I would be able to write about my own generation because I think we have a lot in common. I don’t think kids or people really change but we definitely sound different and I want to get that sound and feeling right. 

If there is anybody that could give me primary sources or point me in the direction of some great books I would really appreciate it!",What was it like being a U.S. teenager in 1969?,2019-07-09 17:38:52

AskHistorians,LondonSeoul,0,1,"I was recently reading Simon Jenkin's 'A short history of England' and he included Oppenheimer's theory on Anglo-Saxon settlement as a possible explanation for the Anglo-Saxon presence in Britain. In a nutshell, Oppenheimer (read [here](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/mythsofbritishancestry)) not only supports the view that there was no large-scale or genocidal invasion of Britain by Anglo-Saxons. He actually goes further to argue that not only was the Anglo-Saxon 'invasion' much smaller than historians once claimed but that much of the British Isles was already settled by Germanic peoples.

&gt;The orthodox view is that the entire population of the British Isles, including England, was Celtic-speaking when Caesar invaded. But if that were the case, a modest Anglo-Saxon invasion is unlikely to have swept away all traces of Celtic language from the pre-existing population of England. Yet there are only half a dozen Celtic words in English, the rest being mainly Germanic, Norman or medieval Latin. One explanation is that England was not mainly Celtic-speaking before the Anglo-Saxons. Consider, for example, the near-total absence of Celtic inscriptions in England (outside Cornwall), although they are abundant in Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Brittany.

He goes onto argue that at the time of the Roman invasion, much of southern Britain was inhabited by Belgic peoples speaking non-Celtic tongues:

&gt;In other words, a Germanic-type language could already have been indigenous to England at the time of the Roman invasion.

Oppenheimer claims that the English language could have developed much earlier than currently recognised as a ""fourth branch of the Germanic language before the Roman invasion."" The Anglo-Saxon settlers thus moved into a land already culturally familiar rather than wholly foreign:

&gt;A picture thus emerges of the dark-ages invasions of England and northeastern Britain as less like replacements than minority elite additions, akin to earlier and larger Neolithic intrusions from the same places. There were battles for dominance between chieftains, all of Germanic origin, each invader sharing much culturally with their newly conquered indigenous subjects. 

Question: Has any evidence been found in the last decade or so to support Oppenheimer's claims? Does any of this hold water according to current archaeological and linguistic research? I was surprised to see Simon Jenkins include the theory as a possibility in his 2011 book so I wondered how seriously the claims are still taken.

From gunpowder there are many weapons that have arisen and culminated in cannons before hand held weapons. I can surmise the cannon worked because of the sheer amount of metal to house the explosion and am guessing the thinner metals would have exploded. I guess my question boils down to why?

I'm trying to get some idea on how much of a population moved around seasonally, for whatever reasons, versus the amount that stayed where they were at whatever job they had. I am setting aside the issues of 'is it legal for these peasants to leave the farm' because those vary wildly and an estate was often large enough to include small towns with 'urban jobs' so I figure that didn't require as serious a permission slip from your local landowning tyrant.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically, I'm curious what portion of a given population might venture back from cities and towns, where they might have 'industrial modern' jobs, in order to labor for important seasonal tasks, such as harvesting and planting. I do know that farm hands were paid some kind of wage above room and board, and that itself was good enough to be worth it over starving certainly, but is it worth losing a job you have currently?

&amp;#x200B;

Industrial age jobs were... *scant* on job security, so I cannot imagine that anyone leaving an industrial labor job had an expectation that it would just be there for them when they got back.

AskHistorians,hyperviolator,0,1,"I'm not overly familiar with the history around this, and to be honest the idea may be a wholesale invention of a particular modern writer. I'm not sure, so hence the question.

Basically, the writer Neil Gaiman, famous for things like American Gods, The Sandman, Coraline, Stardust, Good Omens (with Terry Pratchet), and the version of Lucifer in the TV show running now, has a very paricular notion of the afterlife that winds through much of his work:

**You live, and then you die. Upon your death, your ultimate fate is *your* decision.**

Do you believe you're very guilty, and very bad, even down to your unconscious? What's your heart believe? If you think you ought to be tortured in hell -- because that's what you believe is your fate -- your soul is wandering into hell and *will* be tortured. If you believe your fate is to ride off to Valhalla and drink beer with the mythological Thor all day and throw hammers, you're going to be drunk for eternity and throw metal around. That's basically it, but humans just don't 'get' it outside a handful of times ever. If you're in hell, and you believe you've reformed, or even if you just want a vacation, you can trivially walk right out and nothing can force you to stay (but the powers-that-be can still shove you around somewhat, because they're gods and all). The idea is *we* decide, though we don't know it. 

There's a darkly funny moment in one story in Sandman (which becomes the beginning of the Lucifer stories/series) where one day, the Devil decides he's done and basically doesn't need this shit anymore, so he kicks *everyone* out of hell, locks the door, and hands off the key. He wants to live on Earth and just be himself for a good long while. In the process of doing that, he finds one last human soul, chained to a big rock, splayed open in agony and torture. The Devil tells the guy, basically, ""Get out, we're closing,"" and the guy starts ranting about all the terrible things he did a thousand years ago, torture, murder, rape, you name it, he's done it. ""I gotta get punished more! I was AWFUL!"" is his eternal thing. The Devil is like, talk to the hand, and throws him out of hell.

And in good faith, Ciano told the Germans where some of the diary entries were and they found them and according to Wilhelm Höttl, ""afforded ample proof of the immense value which the complete collection would be.""

Regardless, there seems to have been enough debate in Nazi circles about what to do with Ciano. Some wanted to free him, some wanted to turn him over to the puppet state, the Italian Socialist Republic, now that Mussolini had been rescued and ""restored.""

But he was turned over, faced a [show trial at Verona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_trial) and was executed in January of 1944.

Some of what I've seen is that though the order came from Mussolini himself, since Ciano was one of the votes of no-confidence against Mussolini in July of 1943.  But apparently there was also lot of pressure from higher ups in Nazi Germany to kill Ciano.

All of these were either the results of misinformation (whether intentional or not; possible bias or perhaps propaganda (like Herodotus, the father of history, is also known as the father of lies (at least, that was what he was known for at a time) becuase at was later found in the Histories, some connotations were either false or make-believe); or where some facts or evidence were re-arranged in a manner that people viewed as what was fit for them or how they saw it (like The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon where he glorified the legacies and the actions that the Western Roman Empire left behind that impacted Europe but completely neglected the Byzantine Empire); or where there are historical information that you find in plenty of books, articles and websites and are treated as fact or valid but later investigations or later insight of other perspectives of a certain event with say otherwise (like for example, there is a online comic that depicts as Nikola Tesla as a greatest and misunderstood genius who ever lived. I even believed that too until I encountered a detailed article (I think it was on reddit as well, I cannot remember) that debunked the whole article and treated it as rhetoric. Or another example is when later investigations found that the pyramids were probably built by paid workers, not by slaves)

Sometimes perceptions of historical events have influenced other areas like works of art like the story of Nazi Germany and WW2 have influenced the moulding of the archetype of the crazy army and fanatical dictator stereotype that wants to conquer the world for the sake of world domination or fanaticism regardless of the history that led to it or the factors that influenced in the background that led to it. Or how current perceptions of history can influence how we view historical events from the current 21st century perspective which can hinder us from fully understanding how it was at that time like for example our views towards imperialism vs how imperialism was practiced beforehand and why;, or how certain civilisations get more attention over others (this is something that puzzles me actually) while the others are neglected and their legacies and influences are hindered from being recognised, explored or even given the attention for whatever secrets they may hold (like for example Damascus steel or the Nazca lines of Peru)

There are plenty of people involved here - historians who have to examine the perspectives of the people who wrote these histories, whether it is from other books, letters, drawings, diaries and so on; then you have the people themselves who even wrote these stories in the beginning which could differ in context, description, accuracy or exaggeration; then you have the authors of the history books, the academic articles, the websites and the forums online, and then you have the teachers and the students who learn and teach what they know and spread the message along. 

So obviously, then it comes to histography and passing those histories along, there is a possibility that errors might come up, perhaps a person understood the story in a different way, or when passing the story by word of mouth could lead ommission/addition/change of certain details, translations from different languages can lead to possible inaccurate mistranslations as different language may not have the exact word of every word from another language or certain words or phrases could interpreted differently, and so on and so forth. 

It sounds like a big thought where I am probably jumping to conclusions without knowing the answers but it is something that makes me think and sometimes even worry when misinformation is spread around treated as valid or factual","When it comes to histography and historicity, how can historians, authors and even the readers of the histories be aware of the accuracy of the histories that they read and write?",2019-07-08 18:18:04

-The refusal of the Conventionists to accept Carranza as president under any circumstances, including Pancho Villa who doesn’t seem to have been especially driven by ideology.

-Calles’ support of Obregón despite Carranza bringing Calles into his cabinet.

-Seemingly the entire country immediately turning against Carranza the moment the split between him and Obregón became apparent.

While it does seem that Carranza favored a strong central government and executive more than his opponents, was somewhat less enthusiastic about radical land reform than many of them, and had worryingly bad relations with the United States, these factors don’t seem like enough by themselves to justify years of continued struggle, economic damage, and loss of life in an already war-weary nation.

But how big was Christianity right before Constantine wins? As in, was its momentum already so great that it would have eventually became dominant without Constantine? How did Christianity get in the running to become a huge religion that an emperor would be willing to throw his weight behind?

 2) Christianity has underground organizations around Europe

&amp;#x200B;

Wikipedia quote:

""Cupid continued to be a popular figure in the Middle Ages, when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love. In the Renaissance, a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex allegorical meanings. In contemporary popular culture, Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love, often as an icon of Valentine's Day.\[2\] ""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid)

&amp;#x200B;

**Yes, but there must be something specific about Cupid that made him different than other ancient figures of love like Aphrodite. Why didn't Aphrodite become a figure of Heavenly and Earthly love in the middle ages?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Offhand, my first gut guess is ""well, Augustus has a cupid by his knees in Prima Porta just to show the emperor's divinity-- so perhaps putting cupids near figures didn't carry the stigma of cupid being a full blown pagan God that needed to be damned?""

&amp;#x200B;

And my second guess is that cupid looks a bit like angels, so perhaps he translated better into the Christian world of the middle ages than other ancient Greek entities? Weren't many of the pagan statues destroyed / seen as false gods  in iconoclasm? 

&amp;#x200B;

And my only other guess was that maybe is he just cute and small- and that's why he remained popular? Then again, alot of medieval depictions of cupid in books do not portray him as cute- they often give him the face of an old man and adult proportions sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So what is the real answer why Cupid was spared from the damnation/fall in popularity that other pagan figures went through? (if we assume Cupid did originate from Eros)**","If Cupid originates from the ancient Greek Eros, why did Cupid remain so popular in art in the middle ages despites being a pagan in origin?

AskHistorians,chevalier-sans-peur,0,1,"I've recently completed  a uni module on late medieval and early Tudor English history, and one of the topics I explored is popular rebellions and there's a noticeable pattern with them which goes like this - a tradition of popular revolt emerges in the late 14th century with the so-called ""peasants"" revolts in the Home Counties and East Anglia in 1381, reaches maturity in the 1450s with Jack Cade's rebellion in 1450, which attracts support from everyone from gentry down to labourers and is done in the name of the ""commonweal"" (essentially meaning public good/ national interest, and then peaks in the early Tudor period (1485 - 1553) in which there are 7 rebellions which could be called popular (one in 1489, another in 1497, another still in 1525, two in 1536 and finally another two in 1549) before dying out altogether thereafter. I'm not very familiar with the literature on the decline of popular rebellions - my module stopped quite abruptly at 1550 after all - but on a BBC in our time podcast I heard the eminent Tudor historian John Guy argue that it was a result of changes in the social order, or at least perceptions of it. According to him, whilst in 1501 the traditional ideal of a society of orders (priests, knights and labourers all performing their distinctive functions and mutually supporting each other) still held some sway, by 1600 you have the beginnings of a class system of haves and have nots with the propertied and politically enfranchised people (in the case of rural society everyone from prosperous yeomen farmers up) almost invariably siding with the state against the rabble, and the poor having recourse to nothing but localised rioting about single issues (food prices, enclosure etc).

2-how did technology, agriculture, and architecture on the island compare to the Roman and or non-Irish Celtic world world? Was Ireland completely isolated in technological advancement? What technology did ancient Ireland have? 


3-how did ancient Irish communities, tribes, or petty kingdoms interact with each other and how prevalent was interaction across the Irish sea and beyond. What resources did Irish societies export and import (IE trade) and with whom? 


4-how was information transferred in ancient Ireland? Was there a writing system, and if so, what was used to write upon? How were myths, legends and information passed down among the generations? 


5-how did culture and religion, as well as their associates practices, differ among the four provinces of Ireland (Ulster, Connacht, Munster, Leinster ), and how severe were these differences? 


6-how was war in ancient Ireland fought... what weapons and tactics were used, were there any customs or traditions that were carried out before or after a battle?

AskHistorians,RedSheepCole,0,1,"I vaguely remember reading, in high school history, that the nuclear family (defined as two parents and their children forming a household by themselves) was a post-WWII innovation, and that previously extended was the norm.  I believe the claim was specifically for the US, but a lot of people I talk to have the general idea that people in past societies tended to form big extended clans all living together.  Note that I am speaking specifically of household arrangements, not the social power of extended kin networks or anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

However, what I've been able to find on the subject paints a different picture.  Gies's *Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages* says that nuclear was the highly desired norm in Western Europe, if not always achieved, while my *Oxford History of Byzantium* bluntly states that nuclear was the basic family unit in the East.  Old books like the Little House series appear to depict nuclear households, albeit the extended family plays a stronger role than is typical today.  Jesus's line about a man leaving father and mother implies that, if ancient Jews had extended households, they formed around the bride's parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I am primarily interested in the origins of the nuclear household as a prevalent norm in Western societies here, though I'll take information about other cultures as well if you should chance to have it.

AskHistorians,Dr_Aradius,0,1,"Hi! I have a few questions for the liturgical history aficionados here. As far as I understand the development of Christian liturgy in Late Antique Egypt, the entire Patriarchate of Alexandria in the 5th century would have been using an old form of the Coptic liturgical tradition. When the See of Alexandria rejected the Council, forming the Coptic Orthodox Church, it continued  on with its normal liturgical tradition.

What  about the pro-Chalcedon party in Egypt? Was it initially liturgically Coptic, but became Byzantine over time as result of expected Byzantine  theological (and therefore theological) influence? Or was it perhaps  immediately served by Greek/Byzantine priests? Were there official  Imperial orders that would create a policy of Byzantinization of pro-Chalcedonian communities in Egypt? Do we know how long did the  situation take to settle, how long did the transformation take?

I  understand that the differences between regional liturgical traditions  were not as starkly visible in that period (it took a few more centuries  and a few more controversies along the way), so maybe liturgical transitions weren't that big of a deal in the immediate aftermath of Chalcedon. But I would guess that it didn't take very long either for the Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian parties in Egypt to assert their  theological differences by asserting linguistic and liturgical  differences.

I guess another way of  putting my question would be: how long did it take for the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria to look and sound very unlike the  Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria?",Coptic liturgy vs Byzantine liturgy in Egypt after Chalcedon,2019-07-05 16:47:53

- What did the ""(southern) aristocracy"" think of it and/or the ""new america"" in general? I'm not too familiar with questions like ""who watched broadway plays in the 50s"", maybe it was a lot less ""upper class"" than I imagine it to be.

- How did women react to it?

I'll ignore Blanche here to keep it brief, as Stella/women of the working class family are my main focus.

Stella puts up with her husband beating her and even raping her sister (which she doesnt believe)/sending her to a mental institution. Was her stepping out of her aristocratic upbringing and into ""the real world"" + accepting her husband with all his flaws seen as empowering in some way? Women's empowerment/liberation was still lacking in '47 (Stanley served in WW2, but it's unclear if Stella did work?), was her role in the family seen as positive? Was sex/physical love as central in a 50s relationship as the play depicts it?

I'm wondering how the concept of rape was understood by Europeans of this time period (c. 1300-1600). Nowadays we have a definition of the term tied very closely to the concept of consent. But as far as I understand it this wasn't the case in Europe during the period in question. For example, I've read that spousal rape was not recognized as such, and that prostitutes in some cities could not legally be raped, as they were regarded as belonging to the community. Clearly, consent was not necessarily the main factor that went into determining what was and wasn't rape. So how was rape actually defined? What language was used to refer to it (presumably this varies by region)? Was the concept contingent upon the law - i.e. in the case of the above-mentioned prostitutes, would acts of violence against them be thought of as ""legal rape"" or would they, because they were legal, not be defined as rape at all? What, if anything, was ""consent"" understood to be?

AskHistorians,Wastelander108,0,2,"In Western Media we often see the average Soviet soldier as severely under trained, under supplied, and just generally not at all bright. So a couple of questions regarding such:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What is the extent of Soviet training? We usually see a truck full of fresh recruits unloaded about  300 feet or so from the front line where they undergo very brief training on the basics of using a rifle and that is it before they run straight to the battlefield. Was there no basic training? Was there no military organization into Companies, Squads, Fire Teams, ect.? Or was this a rare event that happened in desperation (such as the Siege of Stalingrad) and then has just been portrayed as being the norm throughout the entire war?
2. Were Soviet troops really that under supplied? A somewhat famous quote from a popular video game goes something along the lines of: ""One man gets bullets, the other man gets a rifle! When the man with the rifle dies, the man with the bullets picks up the rifle!"" Did the Soviet Union really not have enough weapons to supply the army? I personally find that hard to believe considering there are literally millions of authentic Mosin Nagant rifles still in circulation today, some even unused. Furthermore if they really did not have enough weapons for the whole military did they honestly just send unarmed soldiers out to die instead of putting them to work in a logistics unit or something instead where they can still do something to benefit the army without needing a weapon?
3. Now, onto the infamous suicide charge. We have all seen it, hundreds of men bravely charging across an open area towards a fortified position at the sound of a whistle blow, only to be cut down by machine gun fire with no survivors. Was this a legitimate Soviet tactic? Did commanders really throw hundreds of lives away with a single charge with no real plan in mind other than ""Get over there and kill the enemy!""? Or again is this just a case of it happening maybe once or twice and it being turned into a stereotype and generalized as being a constant thing that happened throughout the war?

As a Kurd I think majority of Kurds are convinced that the Medes are their ancestors but majority of historian reject that claim, this made me to search a little bit about this topic.

Lately I've found some Syriac Aramic sources that kept mentioning the Medes as a people till Islamic invasions, even in Bible the Medes aren't extinct people as mentioned in **Acts 2: 8-11** *Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native
language?  Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia*

* Isaac complex in 410 AD mentioned Diocese of the Medes.

+ Aqaq complex in 486 AD mentioned **Abraham the Med**. It's believed name of the town of **Batnaya** in Nineveh plain came from **Beth Madaya** which means **home of the Medes**.

- Babi complex in 497 AD mentioned Median bishop.

* Grigor Complex in 605 AD mentioned Median bishop.

+ Joseph complex in 554 AD mentioned that Aqaq is Bishop of the Medes.

- And finally **Tertullian** an early Christian author in 2nd century mentioned that **The Medes** are believer of **Jesus**.


I have more sources that mentioned The Medes, mostly mentioned them in the geography that Kurds live in today, another confusion thing all these Syriac sources above have mentioned Kurds too, so The Medes and the Kurds were living at same time, a Kurdish historian Soran Hamarash believes that The Medes were elite ruling family of the empire, so even after the fall of their empire they kept ruling small kingdoms for centuries later, it's just like today as we mention Ottomans but in fact Ottomans were only elite ruling family and the rest of people were Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs.. etc.

I want to know why they kept mentioning the Medes although their empire fall centuries ago, did the Medes survived or they just referred everyone who lived in Ancient Media as Median?

1) What are the relationships between the 1745 Jacobite rebellion and the American Revolution? Were there any notable figures or communities involved in both conflicts? My understanding is that the American Patriots did not look particularly kindly on the Jacobite cause, even going to far as to compare Parliament's acts to Jacobitism, as seen in this political [cartoon](http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/british/brit-2.html#obj2) celebrating the ""death"" of the Stamp Act in 1766 - the skulls have the dates of the Jacobite rebellions on them. My very vague understanding of North Carolinian history also leads me to recall that the Scottish Highlander communities there tended to support the Loyalists.

2) Historiography: did the remembered relationship between Jacobitism and the American Revolution change over time? I'm especially curious if this is something that changed in the American South in the 19th century, especially after the Civil War.

After the wars, he became an engineering professor in the 60's and 70's.  He told me of his colleagues who had a plan to turn the US socialist.  It had three parts.

Part 1 was to encourage massive amounts of people to get welfare benefits.

Part 2 was for the government to become bankrupt from paying for welfare benefits for such a large amount of people.

Part 3 was for the masses who now could not provide for themselves to overthrow the current US government in favor for a social welfare state which would be run by these academics.

My uncle told me more details of this plan, such as encouraging migration to the US by offering migrants generous social services hence increasing the masses dependent on the state, advocating for universal basic income, and creating a divide among the mostly white middle class (paying taxes) and minority populations in the US (consuming social services in this case).

AskHistorians,camilo16,0,2,"So I have become interested in the history of the Mali empire, and know little about it. I was surprised learning that it was one of the richest empires in history, yet had many buildings made with mud, although it also had buildings made with stone and other materials.

Without much knowledge these are the potential explanations I came up with:

1. Heat: Stone and even wood probably are good at retaining heat, which in an equatorial region could make living quarters an oven without some additional engineering. On the other hand, mud allowed for better heat transmission from the inside towards the outside, making mud a more desirable material for building.
2. Unnavailability of materials: Maybe wood and stone were not abundant in the region and were a hassle to transport. Why bother moving tonnes of stone when you have a perfectly good and maleable construction material right next to you.
3. Lack of military incentive to use stone and other sturdier materials: In europe, it was usually just town walls and castles that were made of stone (with the exception of cathedrals), because they served a military purpose. The rest of the constructions (houses, storage...) where often made of a combination of other materials like cow dung, timber, mud... Depending on the military situation of the Mali empire (number of enemies and whatnot) there would have been little economic incentive to build constructions in stone over mud.
4. Religious/cultural: Maybe they liked the way mud looks more than other materials, kind of like ""Our father's and the father's of our father's built this way and we are not here to break traditions"".
5. I am actually uniformed about the prevalence of mud based architecture in the Mali empire and as a matter of fact each construction was made of solid gold and the Mali empire is, in fact, El Dorado.

AskHistorians,AH_LA_questioner,0,1,"During the colonization of the Americas, a lot of new churches must have been constructed, and these churches would (eventually?) need names.

I know of two church naming phenomena that jave always interested me, and I was wondering if there were any centralized rules about what names could be used with churches.

First, in many towns there is a ""First Baptist"" or ""First Methodist"" church, I suppose signifying it was the first church of that denomination in the town. Was there someone keeping track of this ordinal naming at a central committee somewhere? Or were there other rules about ordinal naming, or examples of conflict arising from disputed claims of being ""First""?

Second, many Presbyterian churches in the SE USA have names derived from biblical geography, such as Bethesda, Beersheba, Carmel, etc. Was there a standard list of names these churches could pick from? Any names that were forbidden or reserved? How did the congregation decide what the name would be?

I reminded him that the Battle of Sullivan's Island was a decisive victory over the Bittish Royal Navy that not only secured Charleston Harbor from the invading Brittish but it sent them high tailing their Navy to New York. SC delegates rode to Philadelphia and informed our founding fathers of this victory and they struck, declared independence from England as a result of this great victory.
