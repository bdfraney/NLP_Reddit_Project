**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;q=flair%3ASASQ""&gt;Previous weeks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I am Dr Karen Dempsey, a medieval  archaeologist based at the University of Reading where I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow - basically a post-doctoral researcher. My current project is called Herstory. It focuses on understanding medieval castles, from a feminist perspective....in other words telling inclusive stories of people living in castles beyond war, power (or horses!!). I am particularly interested in medieval women, my work includes studies of the things they used loved and care about as well as they places they lived - castles. I am also interested in eco-feminism, female devotional practice (in the garden - sowing seeds as prayers anyone??). I am also interested in how modern communities engage with material heritage especially in relation to castles.

Perhaps this might not even belong here, it might be more of a sociology question. I am not sure but I hope someone here can shed some light. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time: Before writing became commonplace

Place: I am going to assume that would be not as relevant as I expect the same principle to apply more or less universally.  I hope that is okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

Clarification: I am aware that over the many years oral traditions would change and alter but today I heard a claim (in the context of mythology and meta-stories) that over time, orally passed-down stories, specifically myth stories, were stripped down to their essense and any irrelevant details were dropped, leaving behind only the details which had a meaning. This seems to be counter-intuitive as I would have expected the exact opposite to happen: over time stories would become more and more embellished with each generation adding something to the story. Is it possible to make a general claim (i know, terrible) about the validity of this?

&amp;#x200B;

Much appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I apologize in advance for the general question! Perhaps this might not even belong here, it might be more of a sociology question. I am not sure but I hope someone here can shed some light. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time: Before writing became commonplace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place: I am going to assume that would be not as relevant as I expect the same principle to apply more or less universally.  I hope that is okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarification: I am aware that over the many years oral traditions would change and alter but today I heard a claim (in the context of mythology and meta-stories) that over time, orally passed-down stories, specifically myth stories, were stripped down to their essense and any irrelevant details were dropped, leaving behind only the details which had a meaning. This seems to be counter-intuitive as I would have expected the exact opposite to happen: over time stories would become more and more embellished with each generation adding something to the story. Is it possible to make a general claim (i know, terrible) about the validity of this?&lt;/p&gt;

A bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.

In addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which ""Ninja Chefs"" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. 

The project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.

These two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.

The first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. 

And what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.

Hell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!

In addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:

""Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death"".

He explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.

Hell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.

I am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?

Can anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!

Did these two definitions always coincide or were there noble knights who didn't train to fight on horses or even fight at all? (or expected to be able to do it at least)

On the opposite, were there ""heavy horsemen"" who weren't formally knights?

Did all the nobles fight on horses or were there nobles fighting on foot or even using ranged weapons? Did this depend on the rank and on the wealth of the noble?

Were all the knights people who completed that special training or could other people be knighted on special occasions as well such as due to a good performance in battle or similar situations?

How often were new knights appointed? Was there one big event during which several new knights were appointed or was there a ceremony for each individual case or does it depend? Was this done by kings, dukes, counts, barons, by all lords independently of the rank or does it depend?

Do we have historical records about how many knights there were in a certain kingdom at any period during the Middle Ages approximately? (this is a quite broad question, I don't care about a specific place or a specific period)

Were all the male children of a noble couple initiated to the knight training of just some of them depending on the type of education the parents wanted for those children?

Are knight-errant's just fictional idealized figures or did something similar really exist?

Was it possible for a lowborn to ever become a knight, or even just a page/squire as a lowborn kid? If yes, how likely was it? Do we have any historical record of this?

Same thing for women, were there women who became knights? Same as above, do we have any historical record of this?

I know about Joan of Arc who was both a woman and a lowborn and she fought on battlefields but that seems like an extremely exceptional case, but I don't know much about her to be honest

&amp;#x200B;

While I've seen [this very comprehensive post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7wwo7w/how_long_was_the_average_basic_training_for_a/) that goes into basic training for what appears to be infantry, how officers become officers if they are not field promoted is a bit confusing

&amp;#x200B;

Let's pretend someone is drafted and is immediately identified as a great candidate for OCS due to having taken a bunch of calculus and a smattering of german. (or you can make up a better reason.  Either way, my fake guy is going to OCS)

&amp;#x200B;

So he's sent to OCS - when exactly does he show up to OCS in the whole long schedule after his draft number is called (after basic's 13 weeks?)

&amp;#x200B;

Now he's at OCS - and while I understand that there are some significant differences in some of the classroom aspects of the different OCS programs due to the nature of the corps in charges (like the navy is not teaching about radar theory) - what exactly was being taught?  What was the program like outside of the classroom?  How did it work? What were they doing during their 90 days? How did one flunk out?   How effective of a program was this compared to officer training (or lack thereof) in the interwar years? (what little research I've done made it sound like there wasn't much officer training in the interwar years and it was done by correspondent course)

Some secondary questions about creating officers.

&amp;#x200B;

let's pretend you're an awesome lady in the WAC - is your OCS experience different?  

let's pretend you're an MD - do they even send you to boot camp? or do they just commission you?  or do you go through OCS?  How similar is an MD's story about becoming an officer to other highly educated groups the militry needed as support staff - Eg Let's pretend you have a masters degree in radio wave theory - are you just snapped up, commissioned, and sent to California - or do they make you do basic and OCS too? - and for someone like an MD or our fake masters degree student Are there conditions where the Military would still want to put you closer to the front lines, like say triage or handling battalion radio, even as an officer, even though you might also do well much further back as support in say a big hospital or a big radar station - and how does this affect the training schedule","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing a bunch of background research for a piece of fiction I am writing, and I am hitting a roadblock in understanding how officers learned how to be officers&lt;/p&gt;

I am starting some research for a fun project and I was wondering if you lovely folks would be able to point me in the direction of good information or resources. I’ll just lay all my cards on the table and if someone steals my idea I can be the old guy in the bar saying that was my idea. But I’m not too worried about that. 

Basically, I am going to write a Scooby-Doo for my own enjoyment and I am going to make it my dream Scooby-Doo movie. I want it set when the show first originally aired and that is Sept. 13, 1969. Back in the “good ol days”.

I like the idea of setting it in the past and seeing how much things are different or the same, yadda yadda, plus I just think it would be fun. 

I have questions about some basic things and some specific things. 

How involved in Vietnam was the average HS student? Did they talk about it? Did boys worry if they did not go to college would they be drafted? Did they protest? Did the support? Was it all of the above?

Some more mundane everyday things. 

How did boys talk about girls? How did girls flirt? What did it sound like? What swear words where they using? How strict were parents? How did adults look at kids? How did kids look at adults? What was the hit movie? What was the hit song? What was the dumb song? Who was the joke of the day?

I hope this rambling gives you an idea of what I am looking for. I want to be able to write about these kids like I would be able to write about my own generation because I think we have a lot in common. I don’t think kids or people really change but we definitely sound different and I want to get that sound and feeling right.

In a nutshell, Oppenheimer (read [here](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/mythsofbritishancestry)) not only supports the view that there was no large-scale or genocidal invasion of Britain by Anglo-Saxons. He actually goes further to argue that not only was the Anglo-Saxon 'invasion' much smaller than historians once claimed but that much of the British Isles was already settled by Germanic peoples.

&gt;The orthodox view is that the entire population of the British Isles, including England, was Celtic-speaking when Caesar invaded. But if that were the case, a modest Anglo-Saxon invasion is unlikely to have swept away all traces of Celtic language from the pre-existing population of England. Yet there are only half a dozen Celtic words in English, the rest being mainly Germanic, Norman or medieval Latin. One explanation is that England was not mainly Celtic-speaking before the Anglo-Saxons. Consider, for example, the near-total absence of Celtic inscriptions in England (outside Cornwall), although they are abundant in Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Brittany.

He goes onto argue that at the time of the Roman invasion, much of southern Britain was inhabited by Belgic peoples speaking non-Celtic tongues:

&gt;In other words, a Germanic-type language could already have been indigenous to England at the time of the Roman invasion.

Oppenheimer claims that the English language could have developed much earlier than currently recognised as a ""fourth branch of the Germanic language before the Roman invasion."" The Anglo-Saxon settlers thus moved into a land already culturally familiar rather than wholly foreign:

&gt;A picture thus emerges of the dark-ages invasions of England and northeastern Britain as less like replacements than minority elite additions, akin to earlier and larger Neolithic intrusions from the same places. There were battles for dominance between chieftains, all of Germanic origin, each invader sharing much culturally with their newly conquered indigenous subjects. 

Question: Has any evidence been found in the last decade or so to support Oppenheimer's claims? Does any of this hold water according to current archaeological and linguistic research?

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this is ok to ask here, but i recently came across a letter my Grandfather had written to his mother. The letter was dated 11/13/1944. It was your typical mom letter, saying things like ""dont worry about me"" and what packages they were sending back and forth to one another. He mentioned that he was in  Marseille and he couldnt tell her what he was doing there but described it as ""not being in a fox hole, but not exactly staying in a hotel either""

&amp;#x200B;

Im not sure what exactly he did in the war, but he was in fox holes so im guess just regular old army infantry grunt? i wish i had more info to share but i didnt know him well and thats all i got.

I'm trying to get some idea on how much of a population moved around seasonally, for whatever reasons, versus the amount that stayed where they were at whatever job they had.

Specifically, I'm curious what portion of a given population might venture back from cities and towns, where they might have 'industrial modern' jobs, in order to labor for important seasonal tasks, such as harvesting and planting. I do know that farm hands were paid some kind of wage above room and board, and that itself was good enough to be worth it over starving certainly, but is it worth losing a job you have currently?

&amp;#x200B;

Industrial age jobs were... *scant* on job security, so I cannot imagine that anyone leaving an industrial labor job had an expectation that it would just be there for them when they got back. So I would assume that this kind of seasonal labor flow was only among the most precarious laborers, and the ones with the fewest prospects.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds like such a simple question but I can&amp;#39;t find a good chart anywhere.

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I&amp;#39;m curious what portion of a given population might venture back from cities and towns, where they might have &amp;#39;industrial modern&amp;#39; jobs, in order to labor for important seasonal tasks, such as harvesting and planting. I do know that farm hands were paid some kind of wage above room and board, and that itself was good enough to be worth it over starving certainly, but is it worth losing a job you have currently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial age jobs were... &lt;em&gt;scant&lt;/em&gt; on job security, so I cannot imagine that anyone leaving an industrial labor job had an expectation that it would just be there for them when they got back. So I would assume that this kind of seasonal labor flow was only among the most precarious laborers, and the ones with the fewest prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, the writer Neil Gaiman, famous for things like American Gods, The Sandman, Coraline, Stardust, Good Omens (with Terry Pratchet), and the version of Lucifer in the TV show running now, has a very paricular notion of the afterlife that winds through much of his work:

**You live, and then you die. Upon your death, your ultimate fate is *your* decision.**

Do you believe you're very guilty, and very bad, even down to your unconscious? What's your heart believe? If you think you ought to be tortured in hell -- because that's what you believe is your fate -- your soul is wandering into hell and *will* be tortured. If you believe your fate is to ride off to Valhalla and drink beer with the mythological Thor all day and throw hammers, you're going to be drunk for eternity and throw metal around. That's basically it, but humans just don't 'get' it outside a handful of times ever. If you're in hell, and you believe you've reformed, or even if you just want a vacation, you can trivially walk right out and nothing can force you to stay (but the powers-that-be can still shove you around somewhat, because they're gods and all). The idea is *we* decide, though we don't know it. 

There's a darkly funny moment in one story in Sandman (which becomes the beginning of the Lucifer stories/series) where one day, the Devil decides he's done and basically doesn't need this shit anymore, so he kicks *everyone* out of hell, locks the door, and hands off the key. He wants to live on Earth and just be himself for a good long while. In the process of doing that, he finds one last human soul, chained to a big rock, splayed open in agony and torture. The Devil tells the guy, basically, ""Get out, we're closing,"" and the guy starts ranting about all the terrible things he did a thousand years ago, torture, murder, rape, you name it, he's done it. ""I gotta get punished more! I was AWFUL!"" is his eternal thing. The Devil is like, talk to the hand, and throws him out of hell.

His intent was apparently to make it to Franco's Spain, so why not just go there?

The readings I've done seem to indicate [his diaries](https://archive.org/stream/GibsonHughTheCianoDiaries19391943TheCompleteUnabridgedDiariesOfCountGaleazzoCian/Gibson%2C+Hugh+-+The+Ciano+Diaries+1939-1943+The+Complete%2C+Unabridged+Diaries+of+Count+Galeazzo+Ciano%2C+Italian+Minister+of+Foreign+Affairs%2C+1936-1943_djvu.txt) were known of and of some importance to many in Nazi intelligence and foreign ministries and that he tried to barter these for safe passage to Spain, which was then to be Hungary, because Ernst Kaltenbrunner didn't want such a high profile person to escape the confines of the Axis powers. 

And in good faith, Ciano told the Germans where some of the diary entries were and they found them and according to Wilhelm Höttl, ""afforded ample proof of the immense value which the complete collection would be.""

Regardless, there seems to have been enough debate in Nazi circles about what to do with Ciano. Some wanted to free him, some wanted to turn him over to the puppet state, the Italian Socialist Republic, now that Mussolini had been rescued and ""restored.""

But he was turned over, faced a [show trial at Verona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_trial) and was executed in January of 1944.

Some of what I've seen is that though the order came from Mussolini himself, since Ciano was one of the votes of no-confidence against Mussolini in July of 1943.  But apparently there was also lot of pressure from higher ups in Nazi Germany to kill Ciano.

I’m fascinated by Korean history, and a question has been plaguing my mind recently. When first divided back in 1945, the Joseon era had only ended.. 35 years prior, due to Japanese invasion. Kim Jong-Un really doesn’t seem to be interested in the historical side of his country, I may be wrong about this, but that is just what it feels like to me. My question was- has Kim Jong-Un dug up any artifacts from the Goryeo and Joseon periods that aren’t already on display? Or does he not care about the historical side of things, and wishes to leave it alone, or ignore if completely? There must be.. thousands of artifacts still buried within the ground in North Korea. Artifacts that may give us even more insight into those periods.

I’m fascinated by Korean history, and a question has been plaguing my mind recently. When first divided back in 1945, the Joseon era had only ended.. 35 years prior, due to Japanese invasion. Kim Jong-Un really doesn’t seem to be interested in the historical side of his country, I may be wrong about this, but that is just what it feels like to me. My question was- has Kim Jong-Un dug up any artifacts from the Goryeo and Joseon periods that aren’t already on display? Or does he not care about the historical side of things, and wishes to leave it alone, or ignore if completely? There must be.. thousands of artifacts still buried within the ground in North Korea. Artifacts that may give us even more insight into those periods.

Hi I don't know if this is the right place to ask about this but here it goes:

I got offered a place to study my PhD at a UK university but I had to defer my start to next year as I could not secure funding in time. Aside of those options offered by the University, I have been looking for funding throughout the UK but, since I am am not a UK nor a EU/EEA citizen, most of these funding options are closed to me. I have been looking at funding in my home country but options are very limited (though easily secured).

Wikipedia quote:

""Cupid continued to be a popular figure in the Middle Ages, when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love. In the Renaissance, a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex allegorical meanings. In contemporary popular culture, Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love, often as an icon of Valentine's Day.\[2\] ""

&amp;#x200B;

**Yes, but there must be something specific about Cupid that made him different than other ancient figures of love like Aphrodite. Why didn't Aphrodite become a figure of Heavenly and Earthly love in the middle ages?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Offhand, my first gut guess is ""well, Augustus has a cupid by his knees in Prima Porta just to show the emperor's divinity-- so perhaps putting cupids near figures didn't carry the stigma of cupid being a full blown pagan God that needed to be damned?""

&amp;#x200B;

And my second guess is that cupid looks a bit like angels, so perhaps he translated better into the Christian world of the middle ages than other ancient Greek entities? Weren't many of the pagan statues destroyed / seen as false gods  in iconoclasm? 

&amp;#x200B;

And my only other guess was that maybe is he just cute and small- and that's why he remained popular? Then again, alot of medieval depictions of cupid in books do not portray him as cute- they often give him the face of an old man and adult proportions sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I did some searching and people can&amp;#39;t solidly say where. There are a couple markers indicating Siberian, but only two. Some of Australian areas as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why can&amp;#39;t we source Native Americans like we can source ourselves currently?&lt;/p&gt;

How did our ancestors clip their nails? I'm thinking all the way from the beginning of ~~homo erectus.~~ Edit: I realized I went too far with this, since homo erectus surely did not care a tiny bit about their nails. But I'm sure you'll understand my question.

From there, I started wondering if having longer nails back at some point might have had some advantage (talking about  humans exclusively).

When and/or how did it become part of the etiquette to have clean and/or cut fingernails. (I do have a feeling it still might not be an universal thing in 2019, due to some cultural differences.)

I have a few questions for the liturgical history aficionados here. As far as I understand the development of Christian liturgy in Late Antique Egypt, the entire Patriarchate of Alexandria in the 5th century would have been using an old form of the Coptic liturgical tradition. When the See of Alexandria rejected the Council, forming the Coptic Orthodox Church, it continued  on with its normal liturgical tradition.

What  about the pro-Chalcedon party in Egypt? Was it initially liturgically Coptic, but became Byzantine over time as result of expected Byzantine  theological (and therefore theological) influence? Or was it perhaps  immediately served by Greek/Byzantine priests? Were there official  Imperial orders that would create a policy of Byzantinization of pro-Chalcedonian communities in Egypt? Do we know how long did the  situation take to settle, how long did the transformation take?

I  understand that the differences between regional liturgical traditions  were not as starkly visible in that period (it took a few more centuries  and a few more controversies along the way), so maybe liturgical transitions weren't that big of a deal in the immediate aftermath of Chalcedon. But I would guess that it didn't take very long either for the Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian parties in Egypt to assert their  theological differences by asserting linguistic and liturgical  differences.

I guess another way of  putting my question would be: how long did it take for the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria to look and sound very unlike the  Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi!

When the See of Alexandria rejected the Council, forming the Coptic Orthodox Church, it continued  on with its normal liturgical tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What  about the pro-Chalcedon party in Egypt? Was it initially liturgically Coptic, but became Byzantine over time as result of expected Byzantine  theological (and therefore theological) influence? Or was it perhaps  immediately served by Greek/Byzantine priests? Were there official  Imperial orders that would create a policy of Byzantinization of pro-Chalcedonian communities in Egypt? Do we know how long did the  situation take to settle, how long did the transformation take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  understand that the differences between regional liturgical traditions  were not as starkly visible in that period (it took a few more centuries  and a few more controversies along the way), so maybe liturgical transitions weren&amp;#39;t that big of a deal in the immediate aftermath of Chalcedon. But I would guess that it didn&amp;#39;t take very long either for the Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian parties in Egypt to assert their  theological differences by asserting linguistic and liturgical  differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess another way of  putting my question would be: how long did it take for the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria to look and sound very unlike the  Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria?&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the question:

Alot of cultures which Christianity has taken over, very little history is left of those cultures, Finnish are rather expectional of having still strong oral traditional remnants of our old beliefs. Question is though, how were the Finnish pagans treated around the time the crusades came? 

I've read something about the Swedish Pope Gregorius IX complaining about Gotland selling horses to Finnish pagans, which was around 1299. I'm not talking about the few remaining and mostly having normal rights type of pagans around past 1400-1500, even if they faced some discrimination still. I mean were alot of them killed, tortured, etc. Past the time of crusades?


Notes:
This question can seem nationalistic, however I believe alot of our culture and such have come from here, rather than Sweden (They have played a role in it though and the people from there have brought our older culture back or contributed to it, which I appreciate). I'm not speaking as if we had a great kingdom, however I personally find excusing our culture always to being Swedish rather unproductive. Being ruled by them for 800 years at most, roughly, can have changed people's perception and treatment. Not to mention being treated better as subjects by them around when people got more christianized, however the sort of ethical question still stands.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the question:&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I've been blitzing through Peter Adamson's excellent podcast [The History of Philosophy](https://historyofphilosophy.net/), in which he covers every major philosopher from the Pre-Socratics to (eventually) the modern day. Most figures are given a twenty-five minute episode wherein he lays out the basics, with bigger names like Plato and Aristotle getting a whole bunch of episodes apiece. It doesn't give a whole lot of depith, but it's perfect for my purposes of getting a vague outline of people I'd heard of but knew nothing about.

Are there any podcasts even remotely approaching this format for other areas of history? Just bitesize, brief chunks that give you the big points? Specifically I would LOVE to learn more about the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. I know a couple of chunks in detail, but next to nothing about the rest of the history. Having said that, I'd listen to something on just about any period that piqued my interest, so recommend away.

Any pointers would be awesome. Thanks team!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all&lt;/p&gt;

So a couple of questions regarding such:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What is the extent of Soviet training? We usually see a truck full of fresh recruits unloaded about  300 feet or so from the front line where they undergo very brief training on the basics of using a rifle and that is it before they run straight to the battlefield. Was there no basic training? Was there no military organization into Companies, Squads, Fire Teams, ect.? Or was this a rare event that happened in desperation (such as the Siege of Stalingrad) and then has just been portrayed as being the norm throughout the entire war?
2. Were Soviet troops really that under supplied? A somewhat famous quote from a popular video game goes something along the lines of: ""One man gets bullets, the other man gets a rifle! When the man with the rifle dies, the man with the bullets picks up the rifle!"" Did the Soviet Union really not have enough weapons to supply the army? I personally find that hard to believe considering there are literally millions of authentic Mosin Nagant rifles still in circulation today, some even unused. Furthermore if they really did not have enough weapons for the whole military did they honestly just send unarmed soldiers out to die instead of putting them to work in a logistics unit or something instead where they can still do something to benefit the army without needing a weapon?
3. Now, onto the infamous suicide charge. We have all seen it, hundreds of men bravely charging across an open area towards a fortified position at the sound of a whistle blow, only to be cut down by machine gun fire with no survivors. Was this a legitimate Soviet tactic? Did commanders really throw hundreds of lives away with a single charge with no real plan in mind other than ""Get over there and kill the enemy!""? Or again is this just a case of it happening maybe once or twice and it being turned into a stereotype and generalized as being a constant thing that happened throughout the war?

As a Kurd I think majority of Kurds are convinced that the Medes are their ancestors but majority of historian reject that claim, this made me to search a little bit about this topic.

Lately I've found some Syriac Aramic sources that kept mentioning the Medes as a people till Islamic invasions, even in Bible the Medes aren't extinct people as mentioned in **Acts 2: 8-11** *Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native
language?  Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia*

* Isaac complex in 410 AD mentioned Diocese of the Medes.

+ Aqaq complex in 486 AD mentioned **Abraham the Med**. It's believed name of the town of **Batnaya** in Nineveh plain came from **Beth Madaya** which means **home of the Medes**.

- Babi complex in 497 AD mentioned Median bishop.

* Grigor Complex in 605 AD mentioned Median bishop.

+ Joseph complex in 554 AD mentioned that Aqaq is Bishop of the Medes.

- And finally **Tertullian** an early Christian author in 2nd century mentioned that **The Medes** are believer of **Jesus**.


I have more sources that mentioned The Medes, mostly mentioned them in the geography that Kurds live in today, another confusion thing all these Syriac sources above have mentioned Kurds too, so The Medes and the Kurds were living at same time, a Kurdish historian Soran Hamarash believes that The Medes were elite ruling family of the empire, so even after the fall of their empire they kept ruling small kingdoms for centuries later, it's just like today as we mention Ottomans but in fact Ottomans were only elite ruling family and the rest of people were Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs.. etc.

I want to know why they kept mentioning the Medes although their empire fall centuries ago, did the Medes survived or they just referred everyone who lived in Ancient Media as Median?

For those of you who haven't set up RemindMe-bot yet (what are you waiting for?), Bigglesworth is in the process of writing an answer to about travel of World War II leaders that has become just stunning of late.

3.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

I am Dr Karen Dempsey, a medieval  archaeologist based at the University of Reading where I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow - basically a post-doctoral researcher. My current project is called Herstory. It focuses on understanding medieval castles, from a feminist perspective....in other words telling inclusive stories of people living in castles beyond war, power (or horses!!). I am particularly interested in medieval women, my work includes studies of the things they used loved and care about as well as they places they lived - castles. I am also interested in eco-feminism, female devotional practice (in the garden - sowing seeds as prayers anyone??). I am also interested in how modern communities engage with material heritage especially in relation to castles.

The farmer was a nice guy who gave Ken and his kids free eggs so later on Kenshiro got really filled with rage when......

A bunch of bandits killed the chicken farmer and ate his eggs and chicken.  They were ranting about how it was worth patrolling for a whole day because they haven't eaten chicken and egg for years and they were having the most delicious meals in a long time. So when Kenshiro heard them talking about this as he snuck into their camp, he killed each and every one of them.

In addition in the TV version of Naruto (which I just finished), the standard food stuff of armies was flavorless foodpills. So an experiment was made in which ""Ninja Chefs"" were created to bring yummy food from a supply route as well as be attached to units for purposes of cooking tasty food for armies. Initially the project was a huge success as more volunteers came for battle positions and troops fought harder after the Ninja Chefs was created. However it has shown some flaws as soldiers in armies began to hack each other in situations where food was scarce and only foodpills were left. 

The project was big enough a success to continue attaching Chef Ninjas to standard combat units but for elite units like special ops and spies, they completely forbade Ninja cooks to be attached because when supply runs out (due to the nature of their missions), the spec Ops, spies, etc kill each other or abandon the mission temporarily to get supplies for the Ninja cooks endangering the campaign.

These two fictional examples remind me of what I read years ago by my high school history teacher.

The first incident was one where a spice trader was traveling in Italy. When a local impoverished family heard of the wagon of spices he was traveling with, they prepared an ambush and killed him, stealing the spice. Now mind you this is a big crime worthy of executions so it was not a joking matter. 

And what they did right away was not sell the spices, but **eat it later that night** and kept it, adding it to meals daily until they won out by the end of the month. My teacher emphasizes that spice was such a rare valued commodity that people were willing to waste it on binge eating rather than selling it for more profits. In addition he mentions trade ships and caravans had problems with employees stealing spice for their own food especially sailors in merchant ships and fights broke out, a couple resulting in murder, because the stealing employee was busted but refused to give up spices.

Hell it was this demand for spices that was the reason for entire exploration expedition and voyages were funded!

In addition my teacher mentions that a sole motivation for Spartans serving overseas in distant lands was better food than what they ate at home. Enough that even retired Spartan soldiers went back to military life just for food. He even told us this quote:

""Now I know why the Spartans do not fear death"".

He explained a king from Italy said that when he tasted a bowl of typical Spartan food and he explained that it was proof of how harsh Spartan life was that even their food was designed to be painful to eat.

Hell one of the reasons for frequent famines across Europe in WW2 my teacher said was because the German army would frequently steal all the good healthy stuff for themselves because Hitler believed German people have the right to excellent food my teacher said. So much that they didn't just steal the bare minimal for daily military nutrition but they stole even stuff the German army didn't need from the commoners of Netherlands and other countries (such as yummy candies Dutch kids ate and the daily bread Ukranians needed to feed a village a day). Simply because Hitler wanted the German army the benefit of eating as much as they want and the finest nutrition and tastiest food spices and sauces to make the best food. It wasn't enough that they take enough to constitute an average diet German men ate during that time, the Nazis wanted to steal even unneeded amounts at the cost of starving the people of Europe just to give German soldiers a pleasant daily culinary experience.

I am wondering why were people willing to kill just so their food can taste sweeter with much sugar? Is it necessary to starve entire towns just so your army has an extra piece of bread per soldier? Was food so bad that not only did people finish a jar of spice on the spot rather than saving it and selling it, but people were even willing to risk their lives on the battlefield and kill people from other country just so that their morning breakfast is tastier?

Can anyone explain why historical peoples acted that way? The notion of serving in war just because Spartan food lacks flavor is ludicrous ! In addition its beyond logic and very hilarious that a group of highwaymen would kill you just because they haven't eaten beef for years (to quote Hokuto No Ken)!

Could it have been used in the 1800s (when the novel is set) in small doses over an extended period of time to give the impression that someone is going mad?

And also, if someone stopped taking it, would they recover quickly?

Otherwise, what other substance known to man in the 1800s would have similar effects on someone's mental state?

If anyone has some knowledge on poisonous plants and has some info for me, I'll be so thankful!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly Nightshade is poisonous but was apparently used for a while by Venetian women as a cosmetic product to redden their skin and dilate their pupils, a look that was fashionable at the time, which is how it got the name Atropa Belladonna (bella donna meaning beautiful lady). In addition to its physical symptoms, the Deadly Nightshade&amp;#39;s symptoms include hallucinations and delirium. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it have been used in the 1800s (when the novel is set) in small doses over an extended period of time to give the impression that someone is going mad?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And also, if someone stopped taking it, would they recover quickly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, what other substance known to man in the 1800s would have similar effects on someone&amp;#39;s mental state?&lt;/p&gt;

Did all the nobles fight on horses or were there nobles fighting on foot or even using ranged weapons? Did this depend on the rank and on the wealth of the noble?

Were all the knights people who completed that special training or could other people be knighted on special occasions as well such as due to a good performance in battle or similar situations?

How often were new knights appointed? Was there one big event during which several new knights were appointed or was there a ceremony for each individual case or does it depend? Was this done by kings, dukes, counts, barons, by all lords independently of the rank or does it depend?

Do we have historical records about how many knights there were in a certain kingdom at any period during the Middle Ages approximately? (this is a quite broad question, I don't care about a specific place or a specific period)

Were all the male children of a noble couple initiated to the knight training of just some of them depending on the type of education the parents wanted for those children?

Are knight-errant's just fictional idealized figures or did something similar really exist?

Was it possible for a lowborn to ever become a knight, or even just a page/squire as a lowborn kid? If yes, how likely was it? Do we have any historical record of this?

Same thing for women, were there women who became knights? Same as above, do we have any historical record of this?

While I've seen [this very comprehensive post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7wwo7w/how_long_was_the_average_basic_training_for_a/) that goes into basic training for what appears to be infantry, how officers become officers if they are not field promoted is a bit confusing

&amp;#x200B;

Let's pretend someone is drafted and is immediately identified as a great candidate for OCS due to having taken a bunch of calculus and a smattering of german. (or you can make up a better reason.  Either way, my fake guy is going to OCS)

&amp;#x200B;

So he's sent to OCS - when exactly does he show up to OCS in the whole long schedule after his draft number is called (after basic's 13 weeks?)

&amp;#x200B;

Now he's at OCS - and while I understand that there are some significant differences in some of the classroom aspects of the different OCS programs due to the nature of the corps in charges (like the navy is not teaching about radar theory) - what exactly was being taught?  What was the program like outside of the classroom?  How did it work? What were they doing during their 90 days? How did one flunk out?   How effective of a program was this compared to officer training (or lack thereof) in the interwar years? (what little research I've done made it sound like there wasn't much officer training in the interwar years and it was done by correspondent course)

Some secondary questions about creating officers.

&amp;#x200B;

let's pretend you're an MD - do they even send you to boot camp? or do they just commission you?  or do you go through OCS?  How similar is an MD's story about becoming an officer to other highly educated groups the militry needed as support staff - Eg Let's pretend you have a masters degree in radio wave theory - are you just snapped up, commissioned, and sent to California - or do they make you do basic and OCS too? - and for someone like an MD or our fake masters degree student Are there conditions where the Military would still want to put you closer to the front lines, like say triage or handling battalion radio, even as an officer, even though you might also do well much further back as support in say a big hospital or a big radar station - and how does this affect the training schedule","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m doing a bunch of background research for a piece of fiction I am writing, and I am hitting a roadblock in understanding how officers learned how to be officers&lt;/p&gt;

* How did World War 1 affect Hitler's mental health and personality?
 
* Was Hitler as motivated for battle as later claims in his life lead us to believe?

* What do we know about Hitler's military career to be truth or propaganda?

I am starting some research for a fun project and I was wondering if you lovely folks would be able to point me in the direction of good information or resources. I’ll just lay all my cards on the table and if someone steals my idea I can be the old guy in the bar saying that was my idea. But I’m not too worried about that. 

Basically, I am going to write a Scooby-Doo for my own enjoyment and I am going to make it my dream Scooby-Doo movie. I want it set when the show first originally aired and that is Sept. 13, 1969. Back in the “good ol days”.

I like the idea of setting it in the past and seeing how much things are different or the same, yadda yadda, plus I just think it would be fun. 

I have questions about some basic things and some specific things. 

How involved in Vietnam was the average HS student? Did they talk about it? Did boys worry if they did not go to college would they be drafted? Did they protest? Did the support? Was it all of the above?

Some more mundane everyday things. 

How did boys talk about girls? How did girls flirt? What did it sound like? What swear words where they using? How strict were parents? How did adults look at kids? How did kids look at adults? What was the hit movie? What was the hit song? What was the dumb song? Who was the joke of the day?

I hope this rambling gives you an idea of what I am looking for. I want to be able to write about these kids like I would be able to write about my own generation because I think we have a lot in common. I don’t think kids or people really change but we definitely sound different and I want to get that sound and feeling right. 

If there is anybody that could give me primary sources or point me in the direction of some great books I would really appreciate it!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am starting some research for a fun project and I was wondering if you lovely folks would be able to point me in the direction of good information or resources.

* State of the art in construction engineering. The pyramids were built thousands of years before this, and fairly large scale construction was possible in Europe. Was it also possible in Africa of the time? 
* Was a written form of language in use? 
* How distant was communication at the time? Was there trade or other contacts with Europe or the Middle East or Asia? 
* What would the average home look like? 
* Were roads in use? 
* How detailed was astronomical knowledge?

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably going to be a bit of an odd question: I&amp;#39;m looking for information about what life was like in 966 CE in Central Africa, at a specific location (27.25º E longitude, 1.85º N latitude). Just a general feel is enough, but I can&amp;#39;t find very much of anything online about it. I&amp;#39;m not even sure what polity or leadership structure was in place there (if any). In particular I&amp;#39;m looking for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State of the art in construction engineering. The pyramids were built thousands of years before this, and fairly large scale construction was possible in Europe. Was it also possible in Africa of the time? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was a written form of language in use? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How distant was communication at the time? Was there trade or other contacts with Europe or the Middle East or Asia? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What would the average home look like? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Were roads in use? &lt;/li&gt;

https://www.amazon.com/Smugglers-Patriots-Merchants-American-Revolution/dp/0930350766","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent podcast of Revisionist History, Malcolm Gladwell presents that the Boston Tea Party was actually carried out by tea smugglers to force colonists to purchase their tea over England&amp;#39;s. Of course, if true, this account would go against the common belief that the Tea Party was organized by colonists as a protest against taxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any truth to Gladwell&amp;#39;s claim?  Or, any truth to the common belief? Or, is there some story in the middle?&lt;/p&gt;

In a nutshell, Oppenheimer (read [here](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/mythsofbritishancestry)) not only supports the view that there was no large-scale or genocidal invasion of Britain by Anglo-Saxons. He actually goes further to argue that not only was the Anglo-Saxon 'invasion' much smaller than historians once claimed but that much of the British Isles was already settled by Germanic peoples.

&gt;The orthodox view is that the entire population of the British Isles, including England, was Celtic-speaking when Caesar invaded. But if that were the case, a modest Anglo-Saxon invasion is unlikely to have swept away all traces of Celtic language from the pre-existing population of England. Yet there are only half a dozen Celtic words in English, the rest being mainly Germanic, Norman or medieval Latin. One explanation is that England was not mainly Celtic-speaking before the Anglo-Saxons. Consider, for example, the near-total absence of Celtic inscriptions in England (outside Cornwall), although they are abundant in Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Brittany.

He goes onto argue that at the time of the Roman invasion, much of southern Britain was inhabited by Belgic peoples speaking non-Celtic tongues:

&gt;In other words, a Germanic-type language could already have been indigenous to England at the time of the Roman invasion.

Oppenheimer claims that the English language could have developed much earlier than currently recognised as a ""fourth branch of the Germanic language before the Roman invasion."" The Anglo-Saxon settlers thus moved into a land already culturally familiar rather than wholly foreign:

&gt;A picture thus emerges of the dark-ages invasions of England and northeastern Britain as less like replacements than minority elite additions, akin to earlier and larger Neolithic intrusions from the same places. There were battles for dominance between chieftains, all of Germanic origin, each invader sharing much culturally with their newly conquered indigenous subjects. 

Question: Has any evidence been found in the last decade or so to support Oppenheimer's claims? Does any of this hold water according to current archaeological and linguistic research?

I am looking for a book on “the” Migration Period, i.e. the time of migration in(to) Europe from the 4th to the 6th century AD. I am interested in the “simple” chronology but also a deeper analysis of its causes, consequences and most important interpretations within academia.

He wants to live on Earth and just be himself for a good long while. In the process of doing that, he finds one last human soul, chained to a big rock, splayed open in agony and torture.

The readings I've done seem to indicate [his diaries](https://archive.org/stream/GibsonHughTheCianoDiaries19391943TheCompleteUnabridgedDiariesOfCountGaleazzoCian/Gibson%2C+Hugh+-+The+Ciano+Diaries+1939-1943+The+Complete%2C+Unabridged+Diaries+of+Count+Galeazzo+Ciano%2C+Italian+Minister+of+Foreign+Affairs%2C+1936-1943_djvu.txt) were known of and of some importance to many in Nazi intelligence and foreign ministries and that he tried to barter these for safe passage to Spain, which was then to be Hungary, because Ernst Kaltenbrunner didn't want such a high profile person to escape the confines of the Axis powers. 

And in good faith, Ciano told the Germans where some of the diary entries were and they found them and according to Wilhelm Höttl, ""afforded ample proof of the immense value which the complete collection would be.""

Regardless, there seems to have been enough debate in Nazi circles about what to do with Ciano. Some wanted to free him, some wanted to turn him over to the puppet state, the Italian Socialist Republic, now that Mussolini had been rescued and ""restored.""

But he was turned over, faced a [show trial at Verona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verona_trial) and was executed in January of 1944.

Some of what I've seen is that though the order came from Mussolini himself, since Ciano was one of the votes of no-confidence against Mussolini in July of 1943.  But apparently there was also lot of pressure from higher ups in Nazi Germany to kill Ciano.

So to get back to my original question ... why did Count Ciano think it was a good idea to ""escape"" to Nazi Germany after the fall of the Fascist regime in July of 1943?

**Yes, but there must be something specific about Cupid that made him different than other ancient figures of love like Aphrodite. Why didn't Aphrodite become a figure of Heavenly and Earthly love in the middle ages?**

&amp;#x200B;

And my second guess is that cupid looks a bit like angels, so perhaps he translated better into the Christian world of the middle ages than other ancient Greek entities? Weren't many of the pagan statues destroyed / seen as false gods  in iconoclasm? 

&amp;#x200B;

And my only other guess was that maybe is he just cute and small- and that's why he remained popular? Then again, alot of medieval depictions of cupid in books do not portray him as cute- they often give him the face of an old man and adult proportions sometimes.

Issue 2: The end of the show states that judge Mei Ju-ao of China became a ""victim of the cultural revolution"" in a way which seems to very strongly imply that he was either killed or at least imprisoned and was never able to recover in terms of his career/life in China, but wikipedia states that despite some issues due to his past, he was able to become at least a somewhat trusted member of Mao's Chinese state.

&lt;p&gt;Stella puts up with her husband beating her and even raping her sister (which she doesnt believe)/sending her to a mental institution. Was her stepping out of her aristocratic upbringing and into &amp;quot;the real world&amp;quot; + accepting her husband with all his flaws seen as empowering in some way? Women&amp;#39;s empowerment/liberation was still lacking in &amp;#39;47 (Stanley served in WW2, but it&amp;#39;s unclear if Stella did work?), was her role in the family seen as positive? Was sex/physical love as central in a 50s relationship as the play depicts it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of these questions could be a thread on their own, but as I&amp;#39;m looking for answers in the context of a play, I figured they should be kept as a single thread.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's the question:

Alot of cultures which Christianity has taken over, very little history is left of those cultures, Finnish are rather expectional of having still strong oral traditional remnants of our old beliefs. Question is though, how were the Finnish pagans treated around the time the crusades came? 

I've read something about the Swedish Pope Gregorius IX complaining about Gotland selling horses to Finnish pagans, which was around 1299. I'm not talking about the few remaining and mostly having normal rights type of pagans around past 1400-1500, even if they faced some discrimination still. I mean were alot of them killed, tortured, etc. Past the time of crusades?


Notes:
This question can seem nationalistic, however I believe alot of our culture and such have come from here, rather than Sweden (They have played a role in it though and the people from there have brought our older culture back or contributed to it, which I appreciate). I'm not speaking as if we had a great kingdom, however I personally find excusing our culture always to being Swedish rather unproductive. Being ruled by them for 800 years at most, roughly, can have changed people's perception and treatment. Not to mention being treated better as subjects by them around when people got more christianized, however the sort of ethical question still stands.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the question:&lt;/p&gt;

Recently I've been blitzing through Peter Adamson's excellent podcast [The History of Philosophy](https://historyofphilosophy.net/), in which he covers every major philosopher from the Pre-Socratics to (eventually) the modern day. Most figures are given a twenty-five minute episode wherein he lays out the basics, with bigger names like Plato and Aristotle getting a whole bunch of episodes apiece. It doesn't give a whole lot of depith, but it's perfect for my purposes of getting a vague outline of people I'd heard of but knew nothing about.

Are there any podcasts even remotely approaching this format for other areas of history? Just bitesize, brief chunks that give you the big points? Specifically I would LOVE to learn more about the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. I know a couple of chunks in detail, but next to nothing about the rest of the history. Having said that, I'd listen to something on just about any period that piqued my interest, so recommend away.

So a couple of questions regarding such:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What is the extent of Soviet training? We usually see a truck full of fresh recruits unloaded about  300 feet or so from the front line where they undergo very brief training on the basics of using a rifle and that is it before they run straight to the battlefield. Was there no basic training? Was there no military organization into Companies, Squads, Fire Teams, ect.? Or was this a rare event that happened in desperation (such as the Siege of Stalingrad) and then has just been portrayed as being the norm throughout the entire war?
2. Were Soviet troops really that under supplied? A somewhat famous quote from a popular video game goes something along the lines of: ""One man gets bullets, the other man gets a rifle! When the man with the rifle dies, the man with the bullets picks up the rifle!"" Did the Soviet Union really not have enough weapons to supply the army? I personally find that hard to believe considering there are literally millions of authentic Mosin Nagant rifles still in circulation today, some even unused. Furthermore if they really did not have enough weapons for the whole military did they honestly just send unarmed soldiers out to die instead of putting them to work in a logistics unit or something instead where they can still do something to benefit the army without needing a weapon?
3. Now, onto the infamous suicide charge. We have all seen it, hundreds of men bravely charging across an open area towards a fortified position at the sound of a whistle blow, only to be cut down by machine gun fire with no survivors. Was this a legitimate Soviet tactic? Did commanders really throw hundreds of lives away with a single charge with no real plan in mind other than ""Get over there and kill the enemy!""?

Or again is this just a case of it happening maybe once or twice and it being turned into a stereotype and generalized as being a constant thing that happened throughout the war?&lt;/li&gt;

As a Kurd I think majority of Kurds are convinced that the Medes are their ancestors but majority of historian reject that claim, this made me to search a little bit about this topic.

Lately I've found some Syriac Aramic sources that kept mentioning the Medes as a people till Islamic invasions, even in Bible the Medes aren't extinct people as mentioned in **Acts 2: 8-11** *Then how is it that each of us hears them in our native
language?  Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia*

* Isaac complex in 410 AD mentioned Diocese of the Medes.

+ Aqaq complex in 486 AD mentioned **Abraham the Med**. It's believed name of the town of **Batnaya** in Nineveh plain came from **Beth Madaya** which means **home of the Medes**.

- Babi complex in 497 AD mentioned Median bishop.

* Grigor Complex in 605 AD mentioned Median bishop.

+ Joseph complex in 554 AD mentioned that Aqaq is Bishop of the Medes.

- And finally **Tertullian** an early Christian author in 2nd century mentioned that **The Medes** are believer of **Jesus**.


I have more sources that mentioned The Medes, mostly mentioned them in the geography that Kurds live in today, another confusion thing all these Syriac sources above have mentioned Kurds too, so The Medes and the Kurds were living at same time, a Kurdish historian Soran Hamarash believes that The Medes were elite ruling family of the empire, so even after the fall of their empire they kept ruling small kingdoms for centuries later, it's just like today as we mention Ottomans but in fact Ottomans were only elite ruling family and the rest of people were Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs.. etc.

I want to know why they kept mentioning the Medes although their empire fall centuries ago, did the Medes survived or they just referred everyone who lived in Ancient Media as Median?

They were out there doing the great historical things we know them for, sure, but they were also out there living their lives, making friends, falling in love, having small personal tragedies and victories that probably mattered more to them than many of the things we remember them for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goethe liked to draw, Napoleon was writing a novel he never finished, Casanova wrote a fantasy book, Diocletian had a vegetable garden and often gifted people carrots and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... how important is this?, does it really matter?. For example, knowing that Goethe liked to draw tells me nothing about his influence in German politics, and if I knew his influence in German politics, knowing about his hobbies doesn&amp;#39;t give me any more insight... and yet it feels important in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

For the User's Choice Award in June, /u/cthulhushrugged took the top honors with their answer for [""I am a governor of a village at the height of Genghis Khan's empire.

Winning the Dark Horse Award for the non-flairs, /u/KYWildMan arose up from obscurity to show off their eloquence with [""How would Jesus as the son of a carpenter in a backwater have been able to speak Latin well enough to converse with Pontius Pilate?

Finally, for the Excellence in Flairdom Award for June, 2019, a hearty congratulations goes to /u/Bigglesworth_! For those of you who haven't set up RemindMe-bot yet (what are you waiting for?), Bigglesworth is in the process of writing an answer to about travel of World War II leaders that has become just stunning of late.

We hope Bigglesworth will find a popular history magazine to submit it to someday!

So as always, a big congratulations to the winners, and a big thanks to everyone who contributed to the subreddit in the past month! Also a reminder, if you want to nominate answers for the monthly awards, the best way to do so is to submit your favorite posts every week to the [Sunday Digest](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?q=title%3A%22Sunday+Digest%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)!

&lt;p&gt;June saw some excellent contenders as always, and this month the Flair&amp;#39;s Choice Award was bestowed upon &lt;a href=""/u/Hannahstohelit""&gt;/u/Hannahstohelit&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote about &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c0yyyj/what_was_the_treatment_of_and_view_towards_jewish/erh6vxs/?context=3""&gt;&amp;quot;What was the treatment of and view towards Jewish people in America during World War 2?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the User&amp;#39;s Choice Award in June, &lt;a href=""/u/cthulhushrugged""&gt;/u/cthulhushrugged&lt;/a&gt; took the top honors with their answer for &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c27hqp/i_am_a_governor_of_a_village_at_the_height_of/eriqwkn/?context=3""&gt;&amp;quot;I am a governor of a village at the height of Genghis Khan&amp;#39;s empire. What should I expect to happen after I submit peacefully to Mongol rule?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winning the Dark Horse Award for the non-flairs, &lt;a href=""/u/KYWildMan""&gt;/u/KYWildMan&lt;/a&gt; arose up from obscurity to show off their eloquence with &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bvkzr3/how_would_jesus_as_the_son_of_a_carpenter_in_a/epric8i/?context=3""&gt;&amp;quot;How would Jesus as the son of a carpenter in a backwater have been able to speak Latin well enough to converse with Pontius Pilate? Pretty sure they didn&amp;#39;t have latin classes in Bethlehem schools.&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to the &amp;#39;Greatest Question of the Month&amp;#39;, &lt;a href=""/u/EnclavedMicrostate""&gt;/u/EnclavedMicrostate&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s inquiry of &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/bx7jqe/im_a_first_century_judaean_pig_farmer_whos_just/""&gt;I&amp;#39;m a first century Judaean pig farmer who&amp;#39;s just seen a mystic drown all my pigs in a lake.

If so, how, and how likely would I be to get some sort of compensation?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; was too funny for us not to fixate on, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it lacked substance buried beneath either, with several users all providing some excellent insight into the application of Roman law in the provinces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the Excellence in Flairdom Award for June, 2019, a hearty congratulations goes to &lt;a href=""/u/Bigglesworth_""&gt;/u/Bigglesworth_&lt;/a&gt;! For those of you who haven&amp;#39;t set up RemindMe-bot yet (what are you waiting for?), Bigglesworth is in the process of writing an answer to about travel of World War II leaders that has become just stunning of late. I say &amp;quot;answer,&amp;quot; but answer is the wrong word here, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/c60tfm/how_did_allied_countries_leaders_travel_to_meet/es5qxkf/""&gt;since as the latest version should show&lt;/a&gt;, it has truly reached masterpiece status, and still haven&amp;#39;t attained its final form!

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right. 
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.

* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.

* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).

* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;q=flair%3ASASQ""&gt;Previous weeks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I was surprised learning that it was one of the richest empires in history, yet had many buildings made with mud, although it also had buildings made with stone and other materials.

Without much knowledge these are the potential explanations I came up with:

1. Heat: Stone and even wood probably are good at retaining heat, which in an equatorial region could make living quarters an oven without some additional engineering. On the other hand, mud allowed for better heat transmission from the inside towards the outside, making mud a more desirable material for building.
2. Unnavailability of materials: Maybe wood and stone were not abundant in the region and were a hassle to transport. Why bother moving tonnes of stone when you have a perfectly good and maleable construction material right next to you.
3. Lack of military incentive to use stone and other sturdier materials: In europe, it was usually just town walls and castles that were made of stone (with the exception of cathedrals), because they served a military purpose. The rest of the constructions (houses, storage...) where often made of a combination of other materials like cow dung, timber, mud... Depending on the military situation of the Mali empire (number of enemies and whatnot) there would have been little economic incentive to build constructions in stone over mud.
4. Religious/cultural: Maybe they liked the way mud looks more than other materials, kind of like ""Our father's and the father's of our father's built this way and we are not here to break traditions"".
5. I am actually uniformed about the prevalence of mud based architecture in the Mali empire and as a matter of fact each construction was made of solid gold and the Mali empire is, in fact, El Dorado.
