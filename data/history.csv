history,AutoModerator,0,2,"The (new) weekly book recommendation thread!
Hi everybody,

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged! 

Of course it’s not limited to *just* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, /r/history also has a recommended list of things to [read, listen to or watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist)","Bookclub Wednesday, July 10, 2019",2019-07-10 13:16:35

Title: A girl dressed as man in the army for five years, was found out and raped, then attempted suicide (sorry for the bad translation.. that's pretty much the whole story tho)

Content: The Xichang ROC army found a cross-dressed female soldier, and the story spread around the city. This soldier is 17 years old, from Tibet (XiKang at the time) and has been in the army for 5 years as an orderly. One day in April, a company commander found that his wife lost a piece of clothes, blamed this orderly and forced ""him"" to compensate. The girl ran to another commander for help, but got tied up and sent back to the original company. The original commander was enraged that the girl tried to escape, and ordered to spank ""him"" 100 times, strip ""him"" naked and banish ""him"" from the army. The girl begged to be hit in the palm instead, but got denied. The commander had 4 other soldiers flip ""him"" over and hit ""him"" with a carrying pole. The girl passed out at 70 hits, and then the 4 soldiers poured cold water to wake ""him"" up, and hit another 30 times, for 100 in total. They stripped the girl's upper clothes and were surprised to find chest binders. Then they stripped ""his"" pants and found out ""he"" was a girl.

It turns out that this girl escaped her family because she was forced to marry someone. She said she was in a middle school, but she refused to share any info about her parents or address. The story got out and shook the city, people flooded in to care for her, and gave her pocket money. Females students came in and shook hands with her in tears  (weird but it's in the original text).

However, the commander and the 4 soldiers got into fights over who's gonna marry this girl. And before the girl could fully heal, she was raped and attempted suicide out of disgust and guilt, but was eventually saved.

Anyway, most of the facts come from that book, as Davies has done a great job collecting this little tale. 


[William Lauron DeLaurence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._W._de_Laurence) was an interesting man who ran a publishing company (De Laurence, Scott &amp; Co.) and spiritual supply mail order service from Chicago around the turn of the 20th century. He is most known to occultist today for his tendency to copy other people’s works and slapping his name on it, but plagiarism wasn’t viewed the same way in the past and it was harder to prove. Products from his company are still banned in Jamaica, which naturally means his brand of ‘science’ has a certain prestige there. Still, those aren’t the stories I wish to tell you about. 

The story I want to tell you about is his leadership of a cult, The Order of the Black Rose, intended to elevate African-Americans by worshiping a perfumed cigar-store Indian and whose sister cult only allowed white women to join and then only after they had been weighted in the nude. (Oh, look I buried the lead two paragraphs in)

Knowledge of the cult came to light after DeLaurence told an initiate of The Order of the White Willow that she was, “too fat to be an angel.” 

Now, at the time, there was another more well known cult in the city founded by [Otoman Zar-Adusht Hanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoman_Zar-Adusht_Ha%27nish) founded around Zoroastrianism and fad diets. It continually had issues with the police and press in no small part due to the rumors about the sexual activities they took part in combined with claims it targeted wealth women and young boys. I’m sure everyone can guess what people are going to assume when DeLaurence’s organization comes to light in such an atmosphere. 

After hearing the complaint of Augusta “too fat to be an angel” Murie, the Chicago police raided the headquarters of the Orders and arrested a number of white women, black men, and Delaurence himself for offences under the White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act). This was doubly bad timing as the world heavyweight boxer, Jack Johnson, was awaiting trial for “crimes” under the same act for taking a white woman from Minneapolis to Chicago for “immoral purposes.” 

At trial, the prosecution elected to only go after the orders for fraud, and Murie testified about how DeLaurence had hidden dictographs to record his disciples so he could later pretend to read their minds. DeLaurence was fined $200 and everyone was released. DeLaurence seems to have walked away at this point. 

The cult was supposed to have been disbanded, but in 1923 Helen La Maie said her husband tried to [sell her in exchange for a gambling debt](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19231207&amp;id=jgAsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HboEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=978,3778385):

history,testudos101,0,5," 

Rome had a special governing system in that there was no definite source that the throne derived its legitimacy from. For example, the United States government derives legitimacy  from the people whereas the chinese dynastic system derived power from the Mandate of Heaven. The Roman emperor had no such source of legitimacy, nor does it have a system for succession (such as the English system of male primogeniture) to smooth the transition of power from emperor to emperor. This led to a huge crisis in the 3rd century when men in power or at the head of an army regularly rebelled and proclaimed himself as emperor.

history,sammyjamez,0,17,"This thought has been in the back of my mind for quite a while due to the fact that throughout my time learning about history, I learned that things were not always what they seemed to be or were not how I was taught long ago like how Columbus never actually set foot on American soil and his reverence as an American hero came much later after the foundation of America as a nation (and it was done by Italian immigrants, not Americans), or how the stories of Nero during the great fire of Rome were probably exaggerated and sensationalist remarks of the tyrant that he was during that time to picture him in a bad image, or how I learned that the Greco-Persian war and the Peloponnesian War were not that black and white as I was told before, or how I once taught that the Roman Enpire actually ended after the fall of Rome during the 4th Century but actually still existed as the Byzantine Empire (at least the historians call it that because the Byzantines still called themselves Romans) till the 15th Century. 

All of these were either the results of misinformation (whether intentional or not; possible bias or perhaps propaganda (like Herodotus, the father of history, is also known as the father of lies (at least, that was what he was known for at a time) becuase at was later found in the Histories, some connotations were either false or make-believe); or where some facts or evidence were re-arranged in a manner that people viewed as what was fit for them or how they saw it (like The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon where he glorified the legacies and the actions that the Western Roman Empire left behind that impacted Europe but completely neglected the Byzantine Empire); or where there are historical information that you find in plenty of books, articles and websites and are treated as fact or valid but later investigations or later insight of other perspectives of a certain event with say otherwise (like for example, there is a online comic that depicts as Nikola Tesla as a greatest and misunderstood genius who ever lived. I even believed that too until I encountered a detailed article (I think it was on reddit as well, I cannot remember) that debunked the whole article and treated it as rhetoric. Or another example is when later investigations found that the pyramids were probably built by paid workers, not by slaves)

Sometimes perceptions of historical events have influenced other areas like works of art like the story of Nazi Germany and WW2 have influenced the moulding of the archetype of the crazy army and fanatical dictator stereotype that wants to conquer the world for the sake of world domination or fanaticism regardless of the history that led to it or the factors that influenced in the background that led to it. Or how current perceptions of history can influence how we view historical events from the current 21st century perspective which can hinder us from fully understanding how it was at that time like for example our views towards imperialism vs how imperialism was practiced beforehand and why;, or how certain civilisations get more attention over others (this is something that puzzles me actually) while the others are neglected and their legacies and influences are hindered from being recognised, explored or even given the attention for whatever secrets they may hold (like for example Damascus steel or the Nazca lines of Peru)

Another question comes to mind regarding bias and perception - how can we know if such a thing was actually how it was described or not? As a certain event truly a big deal at that time or did the historians think or treat it as a big deal? (For example, I want to take into context of a random event that happened a while ago involving the blue-black vs white-gold dress. The internet treated it as a big deal but was it truly a big deal? Will historians in the future treat it as such? And this makes me wonder about historical events like for example was it actually a very big deal when the rest of Europe learned about Columbus or was it a big deal for the rest of the Europe when the western Roman Empire fell or when Constantinople fell considering that it was still technically Roman even though it was a shadow of its former self at that time?)

There are plenty of people involved here - historians who have to examine the perspectives of the people who wrote these histories, whether it is from other books, letters, drawings, diaries and so on; then you have the people themselves who even wrote these stories in the beginning which could differ in context, description, accuracy or exaggeration; then you have the authors of the history books, the academic articles, the websites and the forums online, and then you have the teachers and the students who learn and teach what they know and spread the message along. 

So obviously, then it comes to histography and passing those histories along, there is a possibility that errors might come up, perhaps a person understood the story in a different way, or when passing the story by word of mouth could lead ommission/addition/change of certain details, translations from different languages can lead to possible inaccurate mistranslations as different language may not have the exact word of every word from another language or certain words or phrases could interpreted differently, and so on and so forth. 

It sounds like a big thought where I am probably jumping to conclusions without knowing the answers but it is something that makes me think and sometimes even worry when misinformation is spread around treated as valid or factual","When it comes to histography, how can historians, authors and even the readers of the histories be aware of the accuracy of the histories that they read and write?",2019-07-08 10:15:08

history,ThisIsAName111,0,24,"This is a thought that has been bugging me for a little while now.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone knows the story of Hitler's aspiration to become a great painter prior to WW1, a dream that shattered with him being denied admission to the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (probably because of his art being considered by the admission officer(s) (or the Academy's equivalent) as ""mediocre"" or ""unoriginal,"" which would have stood him no chance in a very competitive applicant pool).

&amp;#x200B;

Some people like to discuss this anecdote of Hitler's life as a ""what-if.""  Say, if Hitler was accepted into the academy, somehow, would he not embark on the extremist and violent path we all remember him now for?  Could World War 2 not have had happened (at least the World War 2 we know), and world history be very different accordingly?

That is all very intriguing - at least in my view - to think about.  However, I am more curious about whether said ""what-if"" ever occurred in the minds of the people who rejected Hitler's application.

history,grigoritheoctopus,0,30,"I just finished this book. It is incredible (and incredibly disturbing). It should be required reading for everyone (especially the final chapter), especially as there are currently concentration camps being run by the US government (and funded by the citizens of the US) in operation throughout the country. 

It documents the actions of the titular battalion as they commit mass shootings, ghetto-clearings, and deportation actions throughout their assigned district in Poland during 1942 and 1943. By Browning’s estimation (supported, in part, by the meticulous records kept by the unit), they ended up shooting at least 38,000 people and facilitated the deportation (to Treblinka) of at least 45,000 more. 

The book seeks to understand why ordinary people are able to participate in genocide. It does so by using post-war interviews from members of the battalion as well as official reports and other primary sources from the war years and examining these through different lenses (psychological explanations, economic motivations, etc.). 

Here are a couple of quotes that give a sense of the answer as to how/why people are capable of committing such horrific actions: 

“A number of explanations have been invoked in the past to explain [why people are able to commit/facilitate genocide]: wartime brutalization, racism, segmentation and routinization of the task, special selection of the perpetrators, careerism, obedience to orders, deference to authority, ideological indoctrination, and conformity. These factors are applicable in varying degrees, but non without qualification” (p. 159).

“The collective behavior of Reserve Police Battalion 101 has deeply disturbing implications. There are many societies afflicted by traditions of racism and caught in the siege mentality of war or threat of war. Everywhere society conditions people to respect and defer to authority, and indeed could scarcely function otherwise. Everywhere people seek career advancement. In every modern society, the complexity of life and the resulting bureaucratization and specialization attenuate the sense of personal responsibility of those implementing official policy. Within virtually every social collective, the peer group exerts tremendous pressures on behavior and sets moral norms. If the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances, what group of men cannot?” (P. 189)

All of those conditions resonate with me as I look at the state of the world. Books like this one underscore the vital importance of history in guiding us during challenging present times in the hope of creating a better future. 

It’s a cliché but it’s true: we must learn from history in order to avoid committing the same mistakes over and over again.

Granted LOTR is fantasy, but it is a fantasy about a semi-medieval or pre-modern world. So in the context of such a world, child and infant mortality would be rather high.

I've also had this thought when reading about Abraham Lincoln and how the death of one of his children deeply affected him.

history,mrtracyalan,0,5,"Rather than a corruption of nature by prehistoric humans or an enlightened scheme in pursuit of progress, the Neolithic Revolution was an uncoordinated, multi-generational effort to survive in the dynamic, often hostile environments of the Near East. It was not sudden or centrally planned; instead, it was defined by advances in agriculture and animal husbandry over thousands of years by people throughout the Near East. So why do we persist in labeling it a revolution?

Evidence of planting of wild crops among the Natufian people in the Levant puts a date for incipient cultivation at c. 9000 BCE.^(1) Two millennia later at ‘Ain Ghazal, agriculture had advanced little and supplemented hunting, which was a primary food source for the site.^(2) Technology didn’t sufficiently advance to support farming solely via irrigation until Samarran settlements of northern Mesopotamia c. 5600–5300 BCE.^(3) These long  gaps imply a lack of coordinated effort and sharing of technology to promote rapid advance; in other words, this was not a fully conceived revolution in Neolithic minds. The priority for Neolithic people was survival, not developing agricultural technology—hence the extended chronology of the “revolution” and why its progress varied across the Near East.

In addition to sites in the Levant including Jericho and ‘Ain Ghazal, we see first traces of sheep herding and non-native plant cultivation at Zawi Chemi in the Zagros Mountains.^(4) To the west in Anatolia, Çatal Höyük used irrigation to feed a growing population c. 6000 BCE.^(5) The dispersal of these Neolithic sites reflects local populations that exploited the environment as best they could, using technology available to them at the time.

Exchanges with the environment facilitated the Neolithic Revolution, but pre-historic peoples did not necessarily see the environment as a force to be controlled or overcome. On the contrary, the relationship Neolithic people maintained with nature was one of survival. Some inhabitants of Pre-Pottery Neolithic Period C (PPNC) ‘Ain Ghazal reverted to hunting and gathering after shifts in social structure and environment occurred c. 6900 BCE—not because of a principled stand against agriculture or a desire to be closer to nature.^(6) Semi-sedentary settlements like ‘Ain Ghazal and Pre-Pottery Neolithic Period A (PPNA) site Göbekli Tepe reflect intentional alteration of the environment;^(7) in short, settlement dwellers and hunter-gatherers alike simultaneously changed and coexisted within nature.

Assumptions regarding the enlightened progress of early farmers or the iniquity of these agricultural developments hold little relevance when examining the actual circumstances of Near East Neolithic peoples. The real and immediate challenges of survival compelled interactions with nature and yielded incremental, uncoordinated advances that were significant, though hardly the sudden and intentional turn conjured by the term revolution.

Trying to visualize how armies of 15, 50 or even 100 thousands soldiers would actually look is pretty difficult and crazy, I imagine that in a moving column they would occupy miles and miles of roads, withouth counting all the supply wagons and stuff, and in a campal battle they would stretch to the horizon.

So getting back to the original question: while I can imagine all those troops setting up huge camps in the open, I can't visualize 10-15k soldiers stashed behind the walls of a (smaller) medieval city with no big open spaces. Did they camped in streets, or city squares? did they occupy the invididual homes of the inhabitants? where they always armed and ready to fight off an attack?

So this is a story that has never been published and that might be unique in the history of WWI, and it's my first time sharing it somewhere. A few years ago I found a few postcards albums in an old barn in the countryside of France, postcards that were dated from 1890 to 1930 more or less. The story behind this is that the family who had these postcards was actually some kind of crazy old people who used to steal postcards from old mailbox, when it used to be a public yellow PO box in the street. So the albums are actually full of hundreds of postcards from random people who send news to their families.

So of course, this postcard has never be read by the addressee, and by anyone else.

Here is the translation of the text of the postcard :

""**29 of august of 1918. My dear Quilecaille (family name).**

**So is it working for the extension? I do not know if Devallet has returned a second time, I am going to write him. I believe I will receive a medal, I found a way with my fire pump to drown a boche** ***(insult for German)*** **bombing aircraft from 9000m away in air, that right there is some nice work. You will see this in the newspaper (le Petit Parisien) except there won’t be my name, there will simply be M. X. Anyway I am on it. I wish you health and soon the end of the war.

So that's it, an old true letter of a pilote sending a message to his friend, telling him that he found a way to drown an airplane up in the sky. He might have been running out of ammos and probably used it fire pump and sprayed some water or foam on the other airplane.

history,Real_Carl_Ramirez,0,16,"A few months ago, I heard the following claim:

&gt;The [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation) didn't take root in Iberia, France, and Italy because their languages are somewhat [mutually intelligible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_intelligibility) with [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Language). This allowed even illiterate churchgoers in those places to understand Catholicism, making them harder to sway by Protestants.

At first, the claim made sense to me. But then it dawned on me ""*Why didn't Protestantism catch on in Ireland or Poland, since their languages aren't mutually intelligible with Latin?*"". Also, to say that the Reformation was an ""outgrowth of Germanic cultures"" disregards the large numbers of Germanic Catholics in Austria, Bavaria, Switzerland and Belgium.

So why did the Reformation catch on where it did? 

* Was it just due to the stances of governments? If so, why did certain governments, such as those of Italian city-states, Spain, Portugal, France and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth stick with Catholicism?

* How come some regions were able to strongly resist conversion to the religion of its government? For example:

   * Most Irish stayed Catholic despite being under Protestant British rule

   * Most Ukrainians stayed Orthodox despite being under Catholic Polish-Lithuanian rule

   * Most Poles stayed Catholic despite being under Orthodox Russian rule

   * Most Dutch remained Protestant despite being under Catholic Spanish rule

* [Johann Gutenberg's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gutenberg) 
[Printing Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_Press) is often credited for the spread of the Protestant Reformation. 

   * Does this mean that had another European nation invented the printing press first, they would be bound to be the starting place of the Protestant Reformation? 

   * Was there really a correlation between literacy and the spread of Protestantism? 

   * If so, how come the rich and highly-literate (by their era's standards at least - also, they avidly adopted the printung press) Italian city-states were able to resist the spread of Protestantism?",Why did the Protestant Reformation happen where it did?,2019-07-03 12:04:13

&amp;#x200B;

a couple of weeks ago I saw a post by a guy on here, who was asking how retreating worked in the ancient times.

Now I was wondering, how long did medieval battles usually last. I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with the battles shown in hollywood movies (e.g. Braveheart, where people swing swords, hit armor and cut through limbs without a problem).

 Especially the fact that a lot of armies were composed of levy troops, so I'm assuming the following things about them, please correct me if I'm wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

\- only very few troops had training, military expertise and knew how to fight

\- morale was generally low, as you were fighting wars for your feudal lord/king

\- fighting one on one, or against muliple enemies, especially in close quarters is very tiring business, so once you used your weapon for more than lets say 1 hour, you would become very tired and morale would lower even more. (Of course depending on the whole status of the battle).

\- the equipment of most drafted (levy) soldiers would be of very poor quality

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I'm only assuming those bulletpoints, I haven't read enough sources about the period but I'm very interested to hear your guys qualified opinions.

history,JuicyLittleGOOF,0,9,"The Tollense valley battle is the oldest evidence of a large scale battle in Europe, dating to 1300-1200 BC. It was quite brutal, casualties are estimated to be 750 to 1000 and the total amount of warriors would have been around 4000 men. You can read more about it [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250308033_A_Bronze_Age_Battlefield_Weapons_and_Trauma_in_the_Tollense_Valley_north-eastern_Germany) or [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/slaughter-bridge-uncovering-colossal-bronze-age-battle) if you prefer the TLDR version, as well as look at images of the bones and weaponry. Arrows embedded in bones, cracked skulls, bronze spear tips and wooden clubs were all found at this site. Some arrowheads were bronze while others were flint. Evidence of mounted combat has been found as well at this site.

What is interesting to me is that the battle seemed to happen at a border point between three newly emerging cultures; the Proto-Germanic peoples from the Nordic Bronze Age, The Urnfield culture that seems ancestral to the Celtic peoples and the Lusatian culture, a pre-Slavic culture which lived in what is now Poland. Genetic testing showed that the people who fought at this place were quite diverse, some people clustering with modern Scandinavians, some with central and southern Europeans and some with modern day Poles, I think this correlates quite well with the cultural regions. Isotropic evidence has shown that some people who died at this battle grew up eating millet, which was not a common crop in northern Europe at the time.

Some of the findings at this battle were not weapons, but golden and tin spiraled rings. [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250308166_Bronze_Age_tin_rings_from_the_Tollense_valley_in_Northeastern_Germany) is another publication from researchgate which discusses these rings in detail. I do not think these were ornamental, but rather ingots, and this publication seems to agree with me.

The Urnfield culture originated in Southern Germany and Austria, which are rich in metal ores, Tin in particular occurs in the Ore mountains which is on the Border of Saxony and Bohemia. I think this is why the Celtic culture was so widespread in early central Europe, as they had access to a lot copper and tin, which means that you can make bronze. Which is really good for trading, and it probably gave birth or accelerated their warrior elite social classes.

So essentially these Proto-Celts were the cool new kids on the block, with fancy shiny armor, weapons and ornaments. These people would go around and trade, and other people thought they were cool and wanted to be like them, so they did. This brings me to the Lusatians, the pre-Slavic Poles.

The Lusatians were heavily influenced by the Urnfield culture, as their ancestors, the Trzciniec (I had to google that), traded with the predecesors of the Urnfield culture, the Tumulus, which ultimately gave rise to the Lusatian cultures.

The third people in this story were the people of the Nordic Bronze Age, or the Proto-Germanic people. The ancestors of the Germanic tribes that would plague the Gauls, the Romans, the Britons, and not to mention the Norse, who raided across the entire world. Despite what the Romans, Arabs or the recently converted Anglo-Saxons and Franks would have you believe, the Germanic tribes were not just a bunch of brooding dumb barbarians and neither were their ancestors. The NBA people had extensive trade with both the Lusatians and the Urnfield cultures, since bronze artefacts are commonly found but tin had to be imported. We know that centuries later, the climate in Scandinavia seems to get tougher and since there already was limited farmland, these Germanic tribes start migrating southwards and push the Celtic peoples back.

so here is what I think happened:

A big trading caravan from southern central Europe makes it way up north to trade with the Lusatians. These were dangerous times, especially since Indo-European societies loved to raid for some reason. This caravan is therefore well protected by mercenaries from different parts of the Celtic sphere, some of them mounted on horseback. Professional soldiers with bronze weaponry. This trading caravan is travelling north to trade metals like gold, tin and bronze, and probably return with amber and furs, maybe slaves too. But while crossing the Tollense river, this caravan gets attacked by a giant warband of marauders, hailing from the north. These Proto-Germanic people probably were the ones responsible for the wooden clubs and flint arrowheads, although I do think the wealthier individuals had bronze weaponry with them.

Unfortunately not enough evidence has been found to indicate who won or lost this battle, however the amount of bronze weaponry we find is quite low. No swords have been found yet marks clearly made by swords have, so someone must have taken the swords from the battlefield. The bodies were also dumped into the river so I think it was pretty clear that they were pillaged after the battle. I do not think a big trading caravan in foreign land which just got attacked by a giant group of raiders would have any interest in collecting the bronze weaponry spread over the battlefield, but the people who attacked with flint arrowheads and wooden clubs would. But who knows, swords were pretty expensive at the time so maybe the figured it was best to at least bring back the swords since the trading excursion did not seem to work out.

This battle is really fascinating to me because I think that the battle probably set the stage for the early history of northern and central Europe. A prequel to the Germanic expansions into Celtic, and later, Roman lands.

Yes, WWII was immensely fascinating for a myriad of reasons, but I was really sucked into the unsexy, unheroic stuff: the logistics of an invasion force, namely Operation Overlord.

Here was a plan to land 2 million men on an enemy occupied beachfront. The amount of coordination required was obviously tremendous, but I simply cannot understand how it ever came to be. It got me thinking about large undertakings of this sort in general. Such as:

* How are contingencies measured and planned for?  

   * Do armies employ statisticians to try and enumerate the likelihood of say, a vital oil tanker being scuttled and thus plan accordingly?
   * If yes, does someone with experience know if the statisticians are ever listened to?
* Are objectives ranked and tiered in an invasion where so much can go awry?  

   * Secure the beachhead, secure the road leading into the village, secure the village, in that order. But are there plans for when the beachhead cannot be secured? Is another decision tree drawn out?
* How does food, drink, and latrines play into all of this? It seems vitally import too

Having less time for the looping part of this now, I was wondering if people tend to start reading about a topic/period with primary sources or contextualise them (and understand their limitations etc.) first by reading secondary sources.

&amp;#x200B;

There's something very attractive about starting with the primary source to me: is somehow feels more authentic and if it has literary interest in its own right you get the full experience without 'spoilers'. But primary sources can be heavier going and occasionally somewhat impenetrable, so the risk is that you read it all without understanding some underlying concept (or worse, imposing some false understanding derived from Rome Total War or something).

&amp;#x200B;

I think my own conclusion in practice ends up being that whatever order it's in I need a clear and reasonably vivid narrative to hang things off to take on more detailed information: if I think the primary sources will give that I start there, otherwise with secondary (sometimes pretty simplistic secondary sources rather than deep analysis just to get the outlines).

Hi all, I was wondering if any of you might be able to help. In the hierarchy of things, the Empress is the 'first wife' of an Emperor. She is from a high-ranking background. This is followed by the other consorts and then by the concubines who might be from a lowly/common background.

From what I have read so far and according to a discussion I had with some friends, I understand that the emperor is not allowed to have other women before the empress and he is not allowed to have other children without first having consummated the marriage with the Empress?

I went into this discussion thinking that consorts are basically concubines and are not legally married to the Emperor and that the only legal marriage is with the Empress. Sure an emperor might love the consort but he doesn't have the power to make her an Empress because she is from a lowly background. Also, this makes all children that the Emperor has with his consorts/concubines illegitimate.

It's a bit confusing and I'm no expert so these are my questions:

* Can an emperor have a child with a female consort without having married an Empress? \[So basically he has a child with a female consort FIRST and then after the child is born he decides to marry a high-ranking woman and name her Empress instead of the female consort.\]
* Since the emperor can't marry the female consort because she's from a lowly/common background, when the child from this consort is born, will he/she belong to the Empress because of the legal marriage? Or how does it work?

Beginning with Richard the Lionheart's wars in northern France, all the way through the Hundred Years War, I am given the impression that there are few redeeming qualities of the constant warring between these two nations.

Maybe some of you can offer contrary insight. But the two nations, as their cultures are concerned, seem very similar. Both at this time were influence by the same Norman stock. Not to say that this fact is always prohibitive of war.

But when we read Roman or Greek history, the impetus for outward conquest seems much more understandable-- these ancient civilizations had almost always something to offer to their less civilized neighbors.

What is it that compelled English to slaughter French and French to slaughter English so constantly? Is there any redeeming answer, or is it really the monotonous warfare of feudalism, influence primarily by pride, titles, vengeance, and the need to stoke the nation's fervor by inventing foreign enemies, so that the country might unify itself against it?

The significance of their supplies is undeniable, so the arguments were focusing on military actions. For those wondering, the argument came up after some presumably americans said the proto-typical ""we saved EU by winning WWII"" 


The argument was mostly that by the time the Americans troops got involved Russia was already gearing up and as the Axis overextended into the East the Russians *pushed* and would have been entirely successful without any of the western theater due to their sheer military might (given, mostly in numbers). According to those giving this argument, this is essentially what was taught in primary European history education, that even if America had not been involved Russia still would have won against the Axis powers. As an American who was taught essentially that we won WWII, this argument, while theoretically making sense, doesn't sound right considering the scale of the French/Africa/Italy campaigns and the amounts of troops, generals, and munitions dedicated to the west.

These are unintentionally fictive visions of historical experience counter to our understanding of the evidence.

Such scenarios are laughable and make for good YouTube videos, but they do little to cultivate understanding of the lived experience of Greek warriors. This does not mean counterfactuals are without value, as they  empower players to engage with historical narratives in ways not possible with passive consumption of scholarship.

 Example Below

## Portuguese Man at War

This is the name given to a very dangerous species of jelly fish. The real reason behind it resides in how well equipped this creature is, and is a comparison to the way the Portuguese ships fought in India.  


Vice-Roy of India, **D. Afonso de Albuquerque**, a military genius of the highest degree commanded a fleet of six ships manned by four hundred men, and entered Ormuz Bay, being surrounded by 250 warships and a 20.000 men army on land ready to dispatch the small Portuguese flotilla.

When the **King of Ormuz** sent aboard an emissary to question Albuquerque, the great Commander told the messenger one phrase: **Surrender yourselves !!!**

This must have provoked an inner laugh from the messenger who left.

When the battle begun, **Albuquerque** made his fleet circle like a carrousel and destroyed most of the ships. He then proceeded to conquer Ormuz with 400 men.

How could this be achieved one must ask. The technical explanation may make some sense, but will not explain the courage of taking such a risk.

In fact we all know that during the U.S.Civil War, canons had to be loaded from their mouths. This was in the XIX Century. However Albuquerque’s canons were equipped with breeches that did not require the canons to be brought backwards to be loaded. It meant that while the enemy’s canons fired a shot, the Portuguese canons could fire six with a range of 1.800 meters against 700 meters of the enemy’s canons. The next issue is that the Portuguese artillery men had discovered the propulsive effect of water. If you throw a stone at a low angle near the surface of the water, the stone will be propelled by the water’s surface and gain more speed.

The second row of canons were placed very near the floating line and the stronger fire power was further enhanced by the water effect, causing the steel balls to not only hit the ship but hit the one behind the first one. Being fired at close to the floating line, the ships would start sinking very fast.

Then one must be aware that the Portuguese knew they were always outnumbered, a certainty that led them to employ all their courage and determination in the fights and battles they engaged.

In many cases, just mentioning the Portuguese would distress an entire army or fleet, knowing the fierceness and bravery of the Portuguese warriors.",Portuguese War Results,2019-06-24 17:30:49

Bringing this up because i often see people saying vikings or Saxons were superior and kicked the other ones ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yea i know the Saxons won most battles, but that mostly due to having more men, specially more Huscarls.  Like one Saxon kind managed to raise a good amount of Huscarls before the battle of Stamford bridge. By the way i know the vikings actually had more men for that battle, but they were spread out.

Or was white used because it was the color of the powder itself? In that case, if they had pink powder and purple powder, why couldn’t the powder also be black?

Or was it that the hair used to make the wig was already white to begin with? Come to think of it, what was the hair sourced from? If it was derived from some natural fiber, I guess it might make sense if the only color option was a white or off-white shade. But surely that could also be dyed some different color.

history,pubgbridgeword,0,20,"My list (it’s similar to most people’s with the top 4):


1. Alexander the Great- Ik many people criticize his ability by attributing his victories to him having a powerful army, but imo Macedonian and Persian armies are closer in ability than people normally believe. Macedonian infantry was leagues better but it was vulnerable in obstacles for example the rivers at Issus and Granicus which Alex still won. I’d like to also point out that Persians also had good Greek mercenaries. When it comes to cavalry, imo Gaugamela proves that Persians had quality cavalry, despite having more than the Macedonians. But other than that, Alex killed a massive empire in 4 years and he has incredible battle tactics, evident by him not losing a single battle. 


2. Napoleon Bonaparte- Conquered most of western Europe after all the other powers declared war on him and brought most of them to their knees. He also fought 60 battles only losing 8 and also implemented the corps system very effectively.

3.(tie) Hannibal Barca- Although many people say he’s a bad strategist, I don’t anyone could’ve done better against Rome at the time. When it comes to tactics, I think he’s the best here for obvious reasons. 

3.(tie) Julius Caesar- Conquered Gaul and won the Civil War against incredible odds. He was very good at strategy, tactics, and logistics.

5. John Churchill, 1st duke of Marlborough- Was amazing at everything, won some incredible battles, and never lost a single one. 

6. Subutai- In the end, he won against everyone he fought, he defeated his enemies and was very fast.

7. Jan Zizka- He was blind, and he defeated imperial armies with his peasant army while outnumbered and never lost a single battle.

8. Khalid ibn al-walid- He fought a lot of battles and only lost once, and he destroyed Byzantine armies time and time again. I would’ve put him higher if the Byzantine army was actually good and if Muslim sources didn’t exaggerate enemy numbers.

9. Scipio Africanus- Great strategist who conquered spain and defeated Hannibal and Carthage.

10. Arthur Wellesly, 1st duke of Wellington- He fought great battles in India, defeated Napoleonic France in Spain, and went on to defeat Napoleon himself, although he got lucky.

 Once it became clear to the Big Three that the Allies would win, FDR appeared to not only get along well with Stalin, he didn’t seem to mind when Stalin would openly mock Churchill and the British for their conduct in the first years of the war, nor did he seem to mind much the territorial halving that would befall Europe in Russia’s overwhelming favor.
Antony Beevor calls much of this realpolitik in FDR’s mind to create the groundwork for the UN, but Richard Overy cites in *Why the Allies Won* that FDR wasn’t above letting his personal biases get in the way of foreign affairs, as he apparently had a strong dislike of German people, which might have influenced his initial desire to turn Germany into an industrially neutered country. This makes me wonder if he ever let his biases get the better of him.

So, can we ever be sure? Was FDR making concessions and refusing to rebuff Stalin to create a peaceful Europe, or did he just like the cut of Uncle Joe’s jib?","Did FDR like Stalin, and dislike Churchill?",2019-06-22 16:03:13

My surname is Steidinger, and my mom was able to trace our lineage back to the 1200’s in Germany. Essentially the Catholic Church demanded the Stedinger pay taxes and tithes, but they refused so the church sent a small army to enforce it. The Stedinger destroyed the army, proceeded to burn down two castles, and fight a 27 year long way that resulted in Pope Gregory IX issuing a full blown crusade against them. The whole affair ended with the “Battle of Altenesch” 

Then in 1934 The Third Reich used the 700 year anniversary of the battle as propaganda and made a large play called “De Stedinge” celebrating the battle. Apparently much of the village is still standing today.

history,wjbc,0,3,"I’m reading *SPQR*, a Roman history by classicist Mary Beard, and I love it.  I come into it after reading *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* (1776-1789), by Edward Gibbon, and *The History of Rome* (1854-56), by Theodor Mommsen.  I knew they were likely out of date as pure history, and I'm enjoying Beard's more rigorous historical account.

I still recommend Gibbon and Mommsen, though, and I wanted to explain why.  Both Gibbon and Mommsen are great storytellers and very revealing of the mindset of their respective times and countries — Gibbon at the onset of the British Empire, Mommsen at the onset of the Prussian Empire.  Both looked to Rome for a model, but drew very different lessons.

Gibbon, living in a country with a history of internal religious conflict, admired the iron rule of great pagan emperors like Marcus Aurelius, and sought the continued separation of church and state and strong rulers chosen by merit.  Aurelius and his four predecessors were all chosen by merit and adopted by the previous emperor.

Mommsen, on the other hand, living in a “Germany” with a long history of division into small states, was more interested in the fall of the Roman Republic and the rise of Julius Caesar.  Mommsen did not mourn the Republic, admiring the strong ruler who could create an empire out of bloody factional chaos.  Yet both Gibbon and Mommsen interpreted history for their own purposes, with an agenda that rendered their tales suspect.

Beard does a great job of separating legend from fact.  She also tries to look at the life of ordinary people, including many slaves, although that’s not easy when there were no biographies written about them.  She points out that for ordinary people during the 200+ years the empire was at its height, it did not seem to matter much who was emperor.

It does not seem clear to her that the bad emperors were as bad as advertised (usually to justify their assassination), or the great emperors as great as advertised (lauded by their chosen successors), or that any emperors were even as important as advertised (by Roman historians who often had their own agendas).  Beard has the modern skepticism of the Great Man Theory of History previously accepted without question by ancient Roman historians and many 18th and 19th century historians.  I'm just getting to the part where Beard looks at how the empire \*really\* ran, almost regardless of who was emperor -- a study of the Roman bureaucracy.","On Beard, Gibbon, Mommsen, and Roman history writing.",2019-06-17 18:00:01

*""""The peasants of Spain lived especially hard lives in an era when life was not easy for anyone. The difference was that Spain was a battleground for much of the Middle Ages as the Christian kingdoms in the north strived to reconquer the peninsula from Saracens who had invaded in the 8th century. Spanish peasants were therefore also warriors part of the time. This was a fact that the French army under Napoleon would learn the hard way in the early 19th century.""*

But also on those lists usually are Napoleon, Alexander the Great, sometimes even Hitler because he commanded “the largest European empire since Napoleon” (I’ve read that exact line at least 10 times this most recent semester in a WWII class).

But this second list always rubbed me the wrong way. Alexander was never a ruler, he was a conqueror who never transitioned to civilian politics to my knowledge.

All of these men’s gains were also lost almost immediately upon their death or defeat. Besides the traumatization of entire generations, it seems the only outcome of some of these massive war empires is that they expanded and contracted at break neck speeds, and do nothing but cause chaos for the common people. From my perspective, the “empires” of Alexander, Napoleon, and Hitler built were nothing like the real greatest empires: Rome, the Mongols, etc. These lasted generations upon generations.

So my question is: What’s the historical consensus on how much these second guys compare as “rulers”, ranking them in an all-around general sense against the longer lasting dynasties? Am I missing something that equates these conquerors with the kings who ruled for 40/50/60 years or more?

In almost every culture, it seems that there have been different classes, with some being more powerful than others. Additionally, there have been many classes of nobility that have existed independently of the governing class. What are the different ways these groups have obtained their relative power over time?

As an example, ancient Egypt had a centralized command economy, and a noble class. Did these nobles still somehow own land? I think there are many other questions that flow from that one alone. How did people acquire wealth in different cultures and economic models over time? 

Are there even other ways that some groups gained social power, independent of wealth? This might open up a deeper question. How do historians define power? How do they define nobility?

I understand the production was co-funded by the Soviet Union and Italy.. what is going on with that relationship? why would the Italian and Soviet states co-fund a film production, surely at the time of filming (1969/70) the relations between NATO Italy and the Soviet Union were a bit more frosty? And it raises even more questions since the Italians also do not featuring in the narrative!

Also I'd like to know to which extent this strategy was successful, of course the Austrian army was fighting on many different fronts at the same time, this would surely put their life reserve on a timer, i know that roughly a third of all Austro-Hungarian casualties happenned on the Alpine front (without considering the almost 500,000 men captured during the Vittorio Veneto offensive) so i wonder how those number fit in the complessive strategic situation.

Finally I'd like to know if such strategy of attrition could've worked without the intervention of German forces on the Alpine front, i know that in many situation the Austrian forces were approaching their total collapse so i want to know how much of this was due to the italian offensive/battles on the Piave.",Question about Cadorna's strategy on the Alpine front during WW1,2019-06-14 14:36:32

&amp;#x200B;

the first thing that stands out to me is Britain's decision to defend Belgium's neutrality and enter the war against the Germans. in the previously mentioned texts the British politicians discuss the notion that major European war could disrupt the current balance of power and potentially end unfavourably for them. If Germany was to defeat Russia/France they would have massive influence over the political realm and challenge Britain position as greatest power. Was this the right decision to make tho. Britain would suffer extremely high casualties in the war the rattled their political system and arguably the decline of the British empire and the passing of the torch to the USA as super power. I know its easy to look back in hindsight but this was an issue that always seem to stick with me. 

The second problem was the extreme damage to the German reputation caused by the invasion of Belgium. However overblown this issue was i feel the Germans suffered an extreme blow to their chances based off this alone. This was something that was hard for me to believe considering how obsessive the German generals were over not being named the instigator of the war in the preliminary stages. 

overall this was a very curious subject for me and i would love to hear any thoughts you might have about it. What would of happened if Britain refused to enforce the treaty ?

My thinking is: Mainly because the war goals of both conflicts basically remained the same. The two principal conflicts in both were Austro-Prussian conflict over Germany (specifically Silesia) and the Anglo-French conflict overseas. When the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed in 1748, everyone knew it would be merely a truce, it solved no issues, and was only signed out of pure exhaustion. The threat of war constantly loomed, causing the dramatic shake-up of the alliances during 1755-1756. 

Some point to the 8-year peace between, but what is the point of peace where we can divide wars into two separate occasions. During the ""Hundred Years War"" England and France had truces lasting nearly 20 years at some points, but we consider that the same conflict. So what difference was an 8-year truce make?

Lastly, the reversal of alliances. 1.) Alliance reversals happen all the time in warfare. And 2.) The switch-up occured because of the previous war and its goals. Austria and France realizing that they were not each others main threats allied to combat the alliance signed between their two greatest enemies. 

That's my evidence, I'm curious as to what yall think. I love having conversations like this, but unfortunately no one I know around here knows enough (or cares) about this topic. Thanks!!",Was 1740-1763 a 23 year long war? Or two separate conflicts?,2019-06-13 06:06:45

&amp;#x200B;

(Longer story) I was playing a mod (Floris) for the game 'Mount and Blade: Warband'. For those who don't know what this game is about (I highly recommend it for gamers), it's a medieval RPG where you build a character, recruit lower ranked troops, fight battles and gain experience for you and your party. Depending on who you recruit, these troops can branch off (In a 'Troop Tree') to become different types of fighters. You can build an army of heavy infantry units, a fast moving cavalry or highly accurate archers depending on how you feel. It's an AWESOME game with cool fighting mechanics and a great story line that you can essentially build yourself. A nod to the historical accuracy of the game is included at the beginning, stressing the fact that if you choose a female character to start, you will have limitations.  Anyways, among the recruits you can take into your army are women.  These women start out like all other recruits, wearing simple farming clothes and carrying improvised weapons. But as they expand, they join different classes, including 'Women Militia, Amazon, Jungfrau and Truus te Paard'. So after seeing this, I started to wonder... Were there any groups or classes of warriors in any culture, throughout history, that only included women? Like I said before, any search on Google only gets results about individual female warriors that were famous. I get it, in many cultures throughout history in the world, women were not expected or considered to become warriors. But I've still heard of groups like 'Shield Maidens', (Which after researching have discovered that their existence is still debated, because no accurate historical evidence has shown that they were actually a thing) so I was wondering if there were any more examples of this.

As far as i understand chainmail first appears around the 5th century BC being developed by Celts or other ethnic barbarian groups inhabiting central Europe and the Balkans, it was prevalent in both the barbarian cultures and was quickly adopted by the Romans being used extensively pretty much throughout the entire Roman period and beyond, the Romans and the various Persian Empires which existed during late antiquity used chainmail heavily and obviously even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire chainmail would remain the most popular form of forged armour until the 14th century AD in Western Europe.

I'm not sure how early the Chinese would have been introduced to chainmail or even if they independently developed it and disgarded it previously, but considering it is known that Han Dynasty China and the Romans/Sassanids had established diplomatic relations and trade existed between Europe/Near East and China as early as 140AD why didn't chainmail become as prevalent in China as it did in Europe?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: i should preface this question by saying that Chain Mail is rarely depicted in artwork or representations of ancient China, my question really boils down to, assuming chainmail is introduced to Han period China around 140Ad - why hasn't it taken over completely within a generation considering the benefits which made it so popular in Europe would also apply in Han China.

They were trained in everything from explosives to encryption, sharp-shooting and hand-to-hand silent killing—and were parachuted into France ahead of the D-Day landings to commit acts of sabotage, rally and train the resistance and cripple the Nazis before the Allied invasion of Europe.

history,AntifaSuprSoldierSid,0,2,"So earlier today, I got a little bored and was reading through a couple of my old books about WW2. And I found this interesting little section in ""Iron Fist: Classic Armoured Warfare Case Studies"", by Bryan Perrett:

https://imgur.com/a/rXiGuGb

In case you can't read it, it describes a gas attack by Japanese troops against British tanks in April of 1942. Two incidents are mentioned: one where a phial is thrown but misses, and one where it is thrown into a Stuart tank ([the phial used in these attacks](http://www.inert-ord.net/jap02h/grenades/tbgas/index.html).)

The whole crew, except for the commander Sgt Campbell, is incapacitated, with Campbell being unscathed as a result of having his head out of the turret during the attack. Campbell then takes back control of the tank, and removes it from the road, before turning it's guns on the site of the ambush. For this action he received a Military Medal.

Naturally, this story peaked my interest. It's fairly odd for one thing: gas was nowhere near as used in combat in WW2 as it had been in WW1, and it's fairly well known that one of the reasons no one broke it out on a large scale for combat purposes, against the other major powers, was due to fear of retaliation. It therefore seems odd that Japanese forces would utilise gas grenades only once, and never bother with them again, as surely if you're going that far you might as well keep it up. 

It's also a bizzare method of disabling a tank, as I'm sure many would agree. Thirdly, there are no citations directly, but it is very specific on the details: 16th April, Sgt Campbell, Burma, Military Medal. These details are the kind of thing that can be checked, so I wanted to.

So now I'm interested. It's a odd story, and I want to know more. I get a couple of my history nerd friends to help me out, and we start to dig deeper. 

First place we find this story replicated, is Tank Tracks to Rangoon, also by Bryan Perrett. [It describes the incident again in a little more detail](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dEURBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%227th+Hussars%22+%22Sgt+Campbell%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivjaGa2NriAhWJThUIHS2NDGwQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%227th%20Hussars%22%20%22Sgt%20Campbell%22&amp;f=false). Same author though, so we can't take it as truth, and it also doesn't give any sources on this incident. We gotta look elsewhere.

Next answer: we go hunting through old newspaper archives, since they'd include this sort of thing. Unfortunately, I failed to make any progress on this front. No mention of our Mr Campbell. 

Eventually, we try going for medal records. [We get to this site.](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/british-military-gallantry-medals/#3-how-to-find-records) We try to find it: no dice. 

We've almost given up by now, but someone points out a name in Tank Tracks To Rangoon: a Lt John Parry, who was the commander of Sgt Campbell. I plug this name into Google with ""Burma"" added in a last ditch hope, and while I don't find any accounts written by him, I do find [something else.](http://www.hut-six.co.uk/WW2data/WO373-Burma%20and%20India.html)

According to the site it's a list of all recommendations for honours given in the region we're looking for. This seems like our place. So we pop in Campbell, and we get... 18 results. Luckily Perrett gave us a fair few details about him so we can sort through them, and we get: Cecil Campbell, a Serjeant in the 7th Hussars who got a Military Medal in 1942. There's also a link to the recommendation, number 0988. 

This takes us to [here.] (https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7363952) ([for those who for whatever reason can't get into that, here's a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/cMuhJIh)

Nothing we didn't know already...but there is an image of the record. If anywhere contains a mention of this incident, it will be the record of the recommendation. Now I could pay £3.50 (??????) to access this without a watermark, but I'm lazy and poor, so that won't happen. Instead, we're gonna do it the hard way.

[For those who want to strain their eyes, a link to the image.](https://imgur.com/a/3Mpz5ZK)

It's not ideal. But you can just read enough. It says: 

""the enemy attacked with gas grenades. All members of the crew except Sgt Campbell, including the driver, were rendered insensible. Although himself feeling sick and giddy, Sgt Campbell climbed into the driver's seat and drove the tank back 100 yards. Sgt Campbell then manned the gun, and in spite of enemy mortar fire, succeeded with his troop leader in inflicting casualties on parties of the enemy in a building and in the open.""

So, that's the story confirmed. Despite it seeming fairly outlandish, and despite (as far as I can tell) only one book covering this incident, it was completely true! 

It's honestly fascinating that this actually occured, and even more so that no one talks about it. Hats off to Perrett for finding it, and thanks must also go to Geoff Sullivan, who is credited with creating the website that allowed me to find his citation. Finally, credit goes to my friends for joining me in such a bizarre search for a small detail in 2 paragraphs of one book.","Guns, Gas and Grenades: my search for an obscure anecdote.",2019-06-08 21:57:20

I engaged in a bit of a thinking exercise as in which country was the strongest country in the World at any one point.

The chart always gives an event as a reason for change.

This is by no means meant to be an authoritative list but simply a fun exercise for myself. If you disagree please tell me which country you would place as number one at any one point and for what time period. Please also note the following guiding principle of this list: if one country is listed as strongest and in the meantime another country grows to a point where one could reasonably claim that these two are of equal strength (e.g. China (Han / Xin) and the Roman Empire) then the country that was initially number one retains the number one spot until it is confidently surpassed (an example of such is China (Sui) and the ERE).

Since today (late by an hour) is the 75th anniversary of D-Day I decided to find where I had this put away. This is a case my grandfather had made for him by a German PoW in France during the Second World War. My grandfather was a medic in the U.S. Army and landed at Normandy on D-Day. I also have a map that detailed the route his unit took across France and into Germany but I don't know where it is right now. My grandfather passed away in 2007 and I was only 11 at the time, I wish I could've gotten more time with him because I would have loved to talk about his experiences during the War. My grandfather became friendly with this German PoW and they would talk during downtime. One story I remember my grandfather telling me is how every time the PoW heard the roar American bombers flying overhead he'd start cursing in German because those bombers were more than likely heading towards Germany.",My grandfather's case from Normandy 1944; made for him by a German prisoner of war.,2019-06-07 05:22:05

Major later went on to singlehandedly kill four SS officers, but ultimately lost an eye to a phosphorous grenade in the altercation. Instead of going home, instead electing to wear an eye patch, he proceeded to capture close to 100 German soldiers on his own and lead them all back to an Allied camp. For his actions, he was awarded a Distinguished Conduct Medal, but refused the award, claiming that the leadership giving the awards was “incompetent”.

In February of the following year, Major was severely injured after a land mine struck the vehicle he was traveling in, tossing him in the air and breaking his back, four ribs, and both ankles. 

Major still refused to go home and in April of that year, he single-handedly liberated the Dutch city of Zwolle by running through the town, tossing grenades and firing his rifle, hoping to simulate the sounds and sights of a full-scale invasion.

The women in the very first class of female recruits for Winston Churchill’s Special Operations Executive (the SOE) were the very first women in combat. They were trained in everything from explosives to encryption, sharp-shooting and hand-to-hand silent killing—and were parachuted into France ahead of the D-Day landings to commit acts of sabotage, rally and train the resistance and cripple the Nazis before the Allied invasion of Europe. We all know the story of D-Day, and with the 75th anniversary this week, it’s important to examine what so many of us don’t know about the invasion through the stories of these incredible women who helped make it possible.

It's very strange that whilst Britain had just hill forts, torcs, chariots and weaponry, Alexander was building Alexandria and Rome had the Colosseum. And centuries before the Med world had philosophy and mathematics,  refined ideas from scholars with identifiable faces and personalities. I think that's what I'm feeling. Celts are faceless to a large extent. The book on Celts I'm reading has to go into detail about what 'the Great Torc' looks like from the La Tene period because there's little to go on other than objects and speculations on burial situations, yet thousands of years before we have the Book of the Dead and names of Egyptian rulers. I understand that writing is the main cause of this disparity, but it just seems almost unbelievable to me that the British Isles didn't have writing until Ogham (I believe) in the 400s AD. I mean, you'd think that the Halstatt culture in the 'core' German zone would've had writing of some form, especially since the Hueneburg settlement is considered by some to be a polis... Why didn't any Celts have writing? We're just a bunch of faceless warriors and farmers until the Romans come along. This isn't a piss take, by the way--I'm from the UK. I've just never thought about how severe the gap in technology is. Can someone discuss this in more detail?

Edits: It's not just a gap in technology. It's the whole sort of cultural presence, the way we perceive the Celts compared to, say, Greeks and Romans. Even the Assyrians had more of a cultural impact, and they are far older.

Furthermore, Carthage was an advanced society who would have shared with Rome many aspects of what was part of the Mediterranean lifestyle of the time (high density maritime trade, urbanity, writing, a diet based on bread,fish,olive oil and wine, wearing open/airy clothing...etc).

Given those elements, I wonder if the Romans considered the Carthaginians as barbarians.

Roman arrogance and utter contempt for the other cultures and people they encountered and submitted is pretty well documented, and only the hellenes were specifically singled out as non-barbarians (after all, they coined the term, and Romans were huge weeaboos for everything Hellas) and considered more or less equal to the romans.

 They never refrained for describing others as barbarians though, but for Carthage I didn't find any mention of them being referred to as such, but nor did I find anything specifically singling them out as non-barbarians. Given the mutual hatred and deep rivalry tha defined the relations between the 2, I'm actually surprised we don't know more about what the romans thought of Carthage as a people and a culture.",Did the Romans consider the Carthaginians barbarians?,2019-06-03 20:27:57

If Morocco was a major power in the Atlantic, they likely would have helped Spain's colonies become independent or fall into the hands of Native Americans.

Morocco had several advantages in becoming a potential major power in the Atlantic:

* Islam, like Christianity, is a proselytising religion which wants more and more people to convert to it.
* Morocco wasn't a military pushover, as demonstrated by them defeating and killing [King Sebastian of Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_of_Portugal) in battle.
* Morocco's territory extended further West and South than anywhere in Western Europe, giving them less distance to cover to get to South America.
* Morocco was far more technologically advanced than the states of Sub-Saharan West Africa
* The location of Morocco just South of Europe meant that:
   * It won't take too long for European inventions to spread to Morocco.
   * Having a direct land route to the Middle East along the Southern shore of the Mediterranean meant that Middle Eastern inventions wouldn't take too long to spread to Morocco.
* Morocco under [Ismail Ibn Sharif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Ibn_Sharif) was an ally of Great Britain, and continued being an ally for several decades after his death.
* Moroccans did develop sufficient seafaring capability to sail the treacherous waters between Morocco and the Sub-Saharan parts of West Africa.

So why didn't Morocco become a major power in the Atlantic or colonise the Americas?

* Were they prevented from adventurism by domestic troubles?
* Did they lack funds to start colonies?
* Would doing so give European nations a reason to attack Morocco and/or its colonies in the Americas?

From my understanding, Ancient Europe seemed to have a really diverse and broad degree of cultural diversity and technology, from the Celts to Latin Rome to Germanic tribes to Hellenic Greece to the Iberian cultures to the Norse. These cultures all seem very unique and distinct from each other, but as I look more into European history, somewhere along the way I sort of notice that European culture as a whole seems to become increasingly similar, especially during the early modern period, where European culture as a whole seems very uniform (For example, comparing ancient Norway to ancient Spain, they would seem totally alien to each other, but in the early modern periods, they do have their differences but they might seem more alike then different).

Obviously, each nation and people retain a significant amount of independent national and cultural significance, but overall, Europe at some point seems to have gotten rid of the diversity in unique ways of life in favor of homogeneous ideas like urban living, agriculture, firearms-based warfare, etc. Even the clothing for most of Europe seems to become very similar in the early modern period, although there were difference between fashions in countries, from my perspective it seems very similar overall.

Is there any specifiable point where Europe went from these diverse cultures and ways of life into the more homogeneous 'civilized' life we know of now?

A history newbie here. I have become interested in Mongol history. I noticed that they were extremely brutal and destructed and conquered a large portion of Asia, the Middle East, India, and Russia.

To me, it seems most of these countries were traumatized afterward.

Also, the rise of communism, fundamentalism, and a generally cynical view about the world exists in this part of the world. It seems these countries lost hope in humanity. They saw the dark side of humanity and to them, any powerful country is a reminder of Genghis Khan.

I was wondering if there is a study on the long term effect of Mongol destruction?

Now clearly Hitler dominated this negotiation, as Chamberlain accidentally conceded Czech sovereignty over the Sudetenland. 

So therefore was the “blackmail” the fact that Hitler now had Chamberlain on-sides against his own cabinet and allies (France and by proxy Czechoslovakia)? And that hitler could sort of dictate the negotiations from there at further meetings?

Or was the “blackmail” the fact that Chamberlain also admitted to Hitler that he felt making peace was important politically back in Britain, because he felt he had staked his premiership to peace?

If the personal union was also terminated, that means Hungary was a “kingdom without a king” from 31 Oct to 13 November, I can’t find any records of a regency during this time, only during the Horthy era.

* The Dutch had basically no government role, and it was a cartel of major corporate players
* The English had private companies running shipping, but got guarantees from the government for things like monopoly
* The Spanish employed full governmental control and oversight. 

As I recall, the book explored the pros and cons of each of those methods. Whether this is a real book, or a conglomerate of experiences from multiple points, if you have any idea what I'm referring to (and I'm not crazy) I'd love a book about this subject in whole or part.

history,creesch,0,6,"Hi! 

As a more serious large subreddit it takes a lot of work to maintain /r/history. This also means that we are always looking to add a few more mods to the /r/history team. 
So we always have a link in our sidebar [to the moderator application page](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application) so people that are interested in becoming a mod can apply there.
However we also like to every once in a while draw a bit more attention to this process, which is why we made this post. This post gives the same information as on the linked wiki page, but it also allows you to ask questions about being a mod. 

## What do we expect from \/r/history moderators?

Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for: 

- **Experienced with reddit and \/r/history:** We are looking for experienced redditors who have been active on reddit with an account that is at least 1 year old. In addition to that we are looking for people who have contributed productively to this community. 
- **A firm interest in history:** We want people that are interested in the subject, so obviously you need to have a firm interest in history. 
- **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators:** You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our backroom subreddit, modmail and discord, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members. 
- **Free time:** You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to actually carry out moderating duties. 
- **Thick skin:** history is a subject people often try to use to push their agenda. When they are not allowed to do so they can get rather nasty. 
- **Willingness to install and use third party tools:** This includes browser extensions aimed at mods as found on /r/toolbox which are essential for moderating as well as using applications for chatting with the team on discord. 

Some of the responsibilities include: 

- Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
- Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
- Enforce sidebar rules.

If you have no idea how moderating works on reddit and want to check out more about that first you can have a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/historymod101).

## What do I get in return? 

There is no monetary reward as it is all volunteer work. However you do get a better subreddit in return and a very friendly team work with. 

## Great, how do I apply? 

You can do so [through this link](https://goo.gl/forms/jY5dBCGgwKgaTxID2), we will ask a few questions we will use in the application process. Take the time to answer them. As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered. 

## How long will the applications be open for? 

We are always looking for new moderators so there is no end date as it is an ongoing process.

The focus of my question is therefore a bit more narrow and specifically pertains to the differences between the capitals themselves and life within (during the stated time periods).

Being relatively familiar with the infrastructure of Rome and its various facilities/amenities at the turn of the second century (roads, aqueducts, bath houses, gymnasiums, restaurants, multi-story apartments, stadiums, etc.), it seems like civilian life in the original capital of the empire could have been great, relatively speaking. 

I am less familiar, however, with the infrastructure of its eastern successor, Constantinople, specifically during the medieval period around 1000 AD. In this aspect, and nine-hundred years apart, how do these two cities and respective capitals of the Empire compare?

Additionally and more generally, beyond just infrastructure, how did the overall quality of (civilian) life compare in Rome c. 100 AD vs Constantinople in 1000 AD? Was one clearly preferable to the other?",How did civilian life in the capital of the Roman Empire compare in 100 AD vs 1000 AD?,2019-05-28 17:03:34

Was communism more popular or less popular amongst the people of South Vietnam?

Obviously, many South Vietnamese wanted to be independent from North Vietnam and/or opposed communism and we’re willing to fight for it. But was this the opinion of the majority?

From what I’ve read, North Vietnam and South Vietnam weren’t really two countries, but rather two regions of the same country governed separately after the French vacated their colony there. The Geneva Accords, in which peace was brokered between the French and the Viet Minh, separated the two regions, but the separation was meant to be temporary until general elections could secure reunification under a single government. The War began after the President of South Vietnam refused to allow the planned elections and reunification in 1955 causing North Vietnam to seek reunification through force.

The South Vietnamese government’s stated reason for not allowing the elections was that they did not sign the Geneva Accords therefor they didn’t have to follow the accords. But that sounds to me like spurious reasoning from a government that may not have thought it wouldn’t get the mandate of the people if the vote took place.

I sincerely apologize if my understanding of these events is wrong or incomplete. I am the opposite of an expert.

I've been studying a book, ""Hitler and the Habsburgs"" (2018) by James Longo, and there was a chapter about how members of the royal Habsburg family tried to reclaim family heirlooms hidden by the Nazis and found by the ""Monuments Men"". However they refused to return the items back to the family.

Therefore two questions for your consideration:

- How often were the national treasures of European nations stolen by the Nazis returned to their proper owners at the conclusion of the war by the Allies? I sometimes wonder if liberators with sticky fingers would be inclined to hold onto a few precious mementos? I view the honesty and professionalism of the so-called Monuments Men or artwork liberators with a high degree of skepticism. 

- How about Germany's national treasures and historical artifacts (from the Middle Ages and onwards)? excluding the questionable Nazi stuff. Were they also throughly ransacked and looted by the Allies as well? I'd imagine medieval castles, museums, and other cultural heritage sites would be quite lucrative for looters.

It goes without saying that the aftermath of the Second World War was a time of terrible suffering and upheaval, especially for civilians. I understand looting and ransacking are often regarded as appealing bounties of war for soldiers, regardless of whether they fought for the Allies or Axis.

history,p-one,0,16,"I've been reading ""The Holy Roman Empire"" by Peter Wilson and it's been fascinating. But it's left me with many questions about what things looked like day to day (especially 1000-14000).

For example on p376 he says ""Armed retaliation through feuds remained a legal way to seek redress under imperial law"" but how did this work in practice? Doesn't raising a militia and attacking another count or prince usurp the authority of the emperor's court?

On p374 he says ""The rest [of Thuringia] passed to the Wettin family [...] who managed to repel royal efforts to escheat it as a vacant fief,"" but how does the emperor make the case that it is ""vacant"" in the first place when there is clear inheritance. This is maybe part of my broader confusion of how the transition from imperial appointments to hereditary confirmation was perceived.

At a high level I'm really enjoying this book but throughout when Wilson gives an on-the-ground example of something I'm often struck with ""wait but how do you justify that action"" or ""don't you have the authority to just make that happen?""

Now,  this makes sense in the context of a video game, where you as an  omniscient observer directly give orders to everyone, regardless of  where they are, and the battles are relatively small-scale and fast. For  example, in a video game, it makes sense for cavalry to ""flank the  enemy and charge them from behind"". The issue I have is that I haven't  found references to such tactics in the history books I read.

If  I return to my example regarding the role of cavalry: a book on Roman  history I read describes that roman cavalry was deployed on the wings of  battle lines and would fight other cavalry units.

history,mctitties6969,0,3,"I've been doing a lot of research into the Easter Rising, Irish War for Independence,  Civil War, etc, and I still have a LOT to learn, but this is one thing that always troubled me.


So, I know that the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising were generally hated by the public until their executions in their own land by a foreign power, and I feel like the same applied for Collins in 1922 after his execution by his own countrymen. He definitely gained a lot of support from Irish Republicans after Bloody Sunday, his 12 Apostles, giving financial support to the families of fallen rebels, etc., but I know he also made many many enemies both overseas and in Ireland for the same things.


I understand the hatred people had for him and the free-staters after the signing of the treaty in 1922 to let England keep control of the northern counties. Collins was definitely more of a militant leader and didn't mind taking the fight directly to the English, but he seemed to know that the treaty was a necessity to an eventual free Ireland. Meanwhile, De Valera seemed to be less about action, but refused to accept any sort of treaty. This probably made it a very hard decision because putting Collins in charge of the Provisional Government could only further intensify the tension between the two countries: England hated by many Irishmen because of centuries of oppression, and Collins hated by England because the new 'leader' personally gave orders to have dozens of British Soldiers and spies executed and led a military revolt against them. But overall, Collins seemed to go down in history as a hero and martyr to the Irish Republic, whereas De Valera sort of just drifted in and out


Could Michael Collins have gone on to lead the Irish Republic and eventually achieve full Irish Independence through his own methods? Or was his execution needed to put a less militant leader in power and promote future peace talks between the two Nations?

The standards set in these books were considered the norm for noble male behavior. When the merchant and middle classes gained wealth and political influence in the 1500s, nobility felt their status was threatened.

Simultaneously lower nobility and wealthy merchants were debating that noble status was not defined by predefined social standing and family Legacy, but by merit and virtue. Some merchant families were living the lives of nobility, while some nobles in Venice were poor and homeless. 

To secure their power and authority I think nobility published even more specific manuals for male behavior in order to enforce their pious respect towards higher nobility, prevent merchant and middle classes from reaching noble status, and to make sure men in Italy did not go against traditional societal norms in regards to social structure. 

They used works by Erasmus, Castiglione, Caroso, Ebreo, Machiavelli, and other influential noblemen to detail the expectations for social behavior, and the punishments for misbehavior was made worse to the point of complete removal of social status and aid by the 1600s.

The current court of opinion places Che on a continuum that teeters between viewing him as a misguided rebel, a coruscatingly brilliant guerrilla philosopher, a poet-warrior jousting at windmills, a brazen warrior who threw down the gauntlet to the bourgeoisie, the object of fervent paeans to his sainthood, or a mass murderer clothed in the guise of an avenging angel whose every action is imbricated in violence—the archetypal Fanatical Terrorist.

history,Epicknight20,0,1,"For AP Chem at my school, I am doing a project on Concrete. Besides go through the chemical formulas for how concrete is made today using Portland cement, I also am hoping to go over the history of the use of concrete starting in 10000 B.C. as well as (maybe) the chemical equations of how Roman concrete and ancient lime mortars were made. As a result, I have a handful of questions about concrete in case anybody knows about them.

1. Did the Romans widely use concrete out of volcanic ash? I have found a source that made me infer it was mostly only used for large projects like the Colosseum, Pantheon, etc,  while the rest of the empire used weak mortar using burned limestone. Simply, I am asking if volcanic ash could be transported hundreds of miles in order to make cement.
2. When a source says a people used a limestone mortar, I have found that means it hydrates Calcium Oxide, just one of the bonding agents in modern cement. Does anybody know the chemical equation for this reaction?  I found that Tricalcium and Dicalcium Silicate (3CaO+SiO2) reacts in modern cement, but limestone only includes CaO and volcanic ash seems to only include SiO2 alongside aluminum and iron. Did the Romans use both to make cement? Is more than just limestone needed to make cement? 

I understand this is kind of a chemistry problem, but there are also historical aspects to it. If there is anywhere I could post this that would be more appropiate, that would be nice. Thanks!",A handful of questions about concrete,2019-05-19 22:54:18

history,XXX00Lost00XXX,0,15,"So Today I was watching a Joe Rogan Podcast with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. In the that podcast Neil at some point is explaining to Joe the affects European colonization had on North/South America, detailing to some extent the devastation European disease brought to the Americas which killed approximately 90% of the Native American population. A scale on which history knows no other. So earlier in the podcast Neil talks about the separation of species ( during the Ice age when people crossed The Bering Land Bridge) and how this was a unique point in history when there were essentially two separate world's who knew nothing of one another. This separation is one if not the single most driving force in the reason why European disease sweeped through The Americas the way it did. Soon after that Neil follows up with how it is a possibly that syphilis might have came from the new world. That's when a very interesting question got into my head. ""Syphilis? That's it? Separated for several thousand years we kill 90% of the population with a whole grab bag of dieses yet what we got from them was ""possibly"" syphilis, how is that possible? The main explanation out there is that Europeans simply had stronger immune systems a product of their environment and daily lifestyles ( larger living communities, Livestock/Cattle ect..) .My problem is native Americans also were known to live in huge communities (Mayans, Aztecs, Incas ect..) although not quite the same as the townships,  ect.. of their western counterparts but still where large groups of people would gather and have contact. I cannot reasonably see how it is possible that i could simply go to another country which i have never been and pick up native diseases and possibly die and spread that diseases  (Malaria, Schistosomiasis, ebola ect) in 2019. Yet at a time where two separate populations of humans are meeting after thousands of years of seperation at a time with much older medicines, the disparities are so drastically different between their effect on us and our effect on them that is seems unreasonable... my theory is what if the disparities weren't as big as we think? What if the worst already came thru. Through history we see many instances factual and debateable when people from the the known world discovered and or migrated to the new world. Yet we see no instances (that I'm aware of) where people from the new world discovered the old..is it not possible, that some events in history could be explained by people accidentally coming from the new world as Columbus did trying to discover india but did not have the means, intentions, knowledge or effect to have made it into the history books, similar to what Leif Erickson did unaware of the significance of their discovery. What if even though they aren't in the history books the effects they had are. I read an article today about how the the bubonic plague has been traced to have originated from Asia based on dna testing https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206309.php. it's funny how I read this today considering in the podcast Neil DeGrasse  mentions how the people crossing The Bering Land Bridge were more than likely people of Asian decent and when the bridge went back up they could only mix with there own genes. So if they populated the Americas their off spring would be of Asian decent all the way until colonization of the americas, although not retaining only Asian features do to micro evolution (Darwanism) after thousands of years in a different enviorment. Now for my question would it not be possible for something like the emergence of The Black Plague to be caused by one person or a group of people going to ""The Old World""?

history,Meowts,0,1,"Here's a multi-layered questions from a non-historian but someone who's interested to know more.

I was just reading an article on homosexuality in history (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/), and something that struck me was how ideas and quotes from past philosophers managed to have an influence on their current politics, and can still be used to defend ideas or positions. A recurring theme in this article is the idea that a ""truth"" is told, and remains the ""truth"" without exceptions (despite science) - and if you're an exception, the governing body will help ease the confusion by making it not exist anymore, at times more so strictly than others.

Part of what I'm wondering is if in those times, it wasn't just ""Man has real good thought, let's follow"", rather more of an ecosystem of interests that helped influence policy and develop ""society"", and if this is talked about in different contexts of history (or perhaps about relationships between the thinkers and the policy makers).

Back to the gays, I'm wondering if things like spreading illness (no disposable, flushable anything at any time before 100-200 years ago?), or personal insecurities (anything non consensual sucks, probably happened a lot, still does, still sucks), or lack of availability to proper lubricants (""unnatural"" indeed if it hurts) had any influence on the minds of policy makers and followers / enforcers, and if it has been written about (I suppose people didn't write much about swollen anuses, but did they?).

I see these all the time in video games, contemporary art, and even medevial art. And also in art that is suppose to be accurate depictions of certain soldiers.

But in real life whenever I see this (on reenactors and cosplayers) their masks tend to be very loose and wag and wave all over the place when they move and fight, and the chains are so loose and see through you can clearly see their entire face underneath the mail.

So are these badly made loose re-enactor masks or is that actually how those masks looked and functioned in real life.

I’m asking because personally I think it looks really lame when it’s all loose and seethrough and looks incredibly terrifying and badass when it’s 0% see through and you can’t see anything but the persons eyes, and the mask is tight on their face and now waving all around and moving all around, and flipping and folding upwards whenever they move or fight in it.

Recently, I’ve been reading Toby Wilkinson’s *The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt*, and it’s got me again questioning how much the kings of ancient Egypt really believed in their religion.

Here’s why I find it kind of confusing. On one hand, the kings of Egypt were deeply focused on the afterlife; during their reigns, they always spent a great deal of effort on having elaborate burial chambers constructed to ensure them a comfortable afterlife, so it seems to me that they must have truly believed that they would one day be reborn in the Field of Reeds.

On the other hand, the kings also made up Horus names for themselves that denoted their power, and the connection between the pharaohs and the gods seems to have waffled between “favored by the gods” to “physical manifestation of a god.” The reasoning behind these titles, and much of the ceremony surrounding the pharaohs, could have been a result of genuine religious devotion, but it seems like the end goal was always to ensure dominion and exercise power.

history,crimsonskill,0,0,"So I'd like some clarification on Celts. I never thought of the Celts necessarily as a people who migrated to overtake indigenous populations. For example, how the lands of North and South America were populated by the Indians. Then, the whites came, overtook them, and established their nations. But in terms of Celts, I see it more like a culture and language that spread. Similar to computers and microwaves in every household. Meaning as the original Celts multiplied and migrated, their culture/language/tech was adopted by the populations that already existed. Like in a way that everybody of these different societies could all fit under this one category of being Celts.

So in regards to the British Isles, something I've been unclear on is where did the Celt culture originate? Did it start in Iberia, and spread to the British Isles? Or were all these primitive people on the west coast of Europe interacting with each other? Thus, they would altogether developed over the centuries to speak a similar language with similar cultural practices we know as the Celts?

history,Real_Carl_Ramirez,0,6,"**Disclaimer**: I am not trying to promote or denigrate any sport here. I don't actually follow any sport closely. 

I am a citizen and resident of Australia, a former British colony. The most popular sports in Australia are swimming, surfing, cricket and ""football"" sports (i.e. Rugby League, Rugby Union and Australian Rules Football). However, soccer is only modestly (but increasingly) popular in Australia, despite our coloniser, the UK, being very much into soccer. After all, if cricket took root in Australia due to British colonisation, why not also soccer?:

* How come soccer didn't take root very much in other British colonies such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India?

* How come soccer did take root in South Africa, another former British colony, especially among indigenous South Africans? 

* How come soccer is more popular than cricket in the former British colonies of Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore?

The reason I ask this question is because I have spent the last 7 weeks travelling around South America, and all the countries I have visited (namely Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile) are very much into soccer. I am not surprised, considering that the colonisers of South America, Spain and Portugal, are also very much into soccer.

I was born in the Philippines, a former Spanish colony in Southeast Asia, but somehow, soccer failed become popular there. 

* Instead, the most popular sports in the Philippines are boxing and basketball.

* Basketball was spread by the Americans (or what Latin Americans call ""Estado Unidense"") when the Philippines was their colony, so is American influence the reason why soccer failed to become popular in the Philippines? 

* I doubt that the low level of Iberian immigration to the Philippines (at least compared to Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil) was the reason why soccer failed to become popular there, because soccer did become popular in the majority-indigenous nations of Peru and Bolivia. 

Speaking of sports spread by the Spanish, how come bullfighting:

* Did catch on in Mexico (I know Mexico's not in South America, but my dad has watched bullfighting there in 2008), Peru and Colombia.

* But did not catch on in the Philippines, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile?:

* It seems especially odd that bullfighting didn't catch on in Argentina and Uruguay, considering their abundance of cattle.

* I doubt that animal rights concerns were the main reason why bullfighting didn't catch on in Argentina and Uruguay. 

Finally, how does climate influence the popularity of sports?:

* For example, I know that the popularity of swimming and surfing in Australia is influenced by our hot climate and our population being concentrated around the coasts.

* So how come soccer can be popular from the taiga climates of Northern Europe, to the Mediterranean, to the Amazon Rainforest, to the Argentine Pampa, to the Bolivian Altiplano, to the Atacama Desert?

* Considering that soccer caught on in the Philippines' neighbours such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia (a former Dutch colony), I doubt that climate was what prevented soccer from catching on in the Philippines.",What factors influenced the spread of sports by colonial powers?,2019-05-16 00:29:54

Im not sure of shes got some thing wrong like my birth dad thinks but she says that he married a white woman in the US (south) in 1847 and that they had kids together and were wealthy and had servants.

Now I'm not a Historian, I do not have the knowledge to make any declarations so I figure why not ask people who may be more knowledgeable and point me in the right direction.

I do not believe religious politicians do anything for religious reasons. I believe they do it for power and the religion is just a gimmick they use to facilitate their power. But if push come to shove they will always do what's in their own best interest to maintain their own power.

So I got to thinking about Modern Conservatives and their idea of limited Government and lower taxes. Is it possible that ""Conservative"" Politicians of the time had an issue with the government of the time and saw Prohibition as a way to sabotage the government of the time knowing it would dramatically reduce the government's revenue?

My contribution:

I know that Iced Sweet Tea here in the Southern United States was exactly that in the 18th and 19th century. Before the invention of modern refrigeration Ice had to be gathered from frozen lakes and shipped across the world, and lots of product would melt before reaching to its destination.

White sugar was the most expensive and most refined end product of cane sugar manufacturing. Lots of slave labor was used in the production of cane sugar, and the human cost and suffering was immense and horrible.

And finally Tea, an already fancy drink. Here in the South we drink black tea, which lots of it was imported.

So sitting on a large slave plantation, sipping from a tall glass of Sweet Iced Tea was not only refreshing for the upper-class, but a symbol of their wealth and power.

history,Briennetarthhhhhh,0,13,"Looking at the world history, Egyptians, Persians, Chinese etc, authoritarian governments seem to be the norm, while democracy is more like a rare mutation.

I don’t think the ancient Greek philosophy of “living a virtuous life”, “rule by many” just happened randomly, but I don’t have much knowledge of how the Greek lived and what are the social factors that might contribute to democracy. 

In general the west seems to be more aware of the legitimacy of the government than the their eastern neighbors, England had the Magna Carta long before the Enlightenment, France and Netherlands had the revolution, Scandinavian countries are closer to “socialism” than any country in the world who claim themselves to be. 


My theory is that this has a lot to do with the population. 

The east was much more populated in general, think about China and India, in a place where there are more people than available resources, competition becomes fierce. People need to “step over” others to get the resource they need, they can only do so by violence. Ruling by fear is the only working way, otherwise it will be in chaos. 

Democracy is a social contract that seems to be much more acceptable in a situation where resources are abundant with people had their basic needs fulfilled. It also seems to be more likely to happen in an isolated, peaceful place where war is not a huge threat. 

When there is less people it also make lives more valuable. The enlightenment thinking emphasizes greatly on “human nature”, I doubt in a overly populated, highly competitive society it will be possible to have the same respect for “human rights”. 

But then I was thinking, is it true that agrarian civilization tends to be more populated? Why Europe was never as populated as the east? 

It will be great to hear some insights from people who have researched on Ancient Greece or European history. I’ll be glad to hear any arguments on this theory and you are welcome to come up with other possible factors/theories.

Title: A girl dressed as man in the army for five years, was found out and raped, then attempted suicide (sorry for the bad translation.. that's pretty much the whole story tho)

Content: The Xichang ROC army found a cross-dressed female soldier, and the story spread around the city. This soldier is 17 years old, from Tibet (XiKang at the time) and has been in the army for 5 years as an orderly. One day in April, a company commander found that his wife lost a piece of clothes, blamed this orderly and forced ""him"" to compensate. The girl ran to another commander for help, but got tied up and sent back to the original company. The original commander was enraged that the girl tried to escape, and ordered to spank ""him"" 100 times, strip ""him"" naked and banish ""him"" from the army. The girl begged to be hit in the palm instead, but got denied. The commander had 4 other soldiers flip ""him"" over and hit ""him"" with a carrying pole. The girl passed out at 70 hits, and then the 4 soldiers poured cold water to wake ""him"" up, and hit another 30 times, for 100 in total. They stripped the girl's upper clothes and were surprised to find chest binders. Then they stripped ""his"" pants and found out ""he"" was a girl.

It turns out that this girl escaped her family because she was forced to marry someone. She said she was in a middle school, but she refused to share any info about her parents or address. The story got out and shook the city, people flooded in to care for her, and gave her pocket money. Females students came in and shook hands with her in tears  (weird but it's in the original text).

However, the commander and the 4 soldiers got into fights over who's gonna marry this girl. And before the girl could fully heal, she was raped and attempted suicide out of disgust and guilt, but was eventually saved.

I first came across this in [Grimoires: A History of Magic Books](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/6146412) by Owen Davies. It’s a wonderful read, the books it discusses are interesting as is their cultural impacts, but it is the conmen and tricksters that are my favorite parts. Now, Davies rarely identifies them as such, he is a tactful historian, but the way he tells the stories. . .you just know. Anyway, most of the facts come from that book, as Davies has done a great job collecting this little tale. 


[William Lauron DeLaurence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._W._de_Laurence) was an interesting man who ran a publishing company (De Laurence, Scott &amp; Co.) and spiritual supply mail order service from Chicago around the turn of the 20th century. He is most known to occultist today for his tendency to copy other people’s works and slapping his name on it, but plagiarism wasn’t viewed the same way in the past and it was harder to prove. Products from his company are still banned in Jamaica, which naturally means his brand of ‘science’ has a certain prestige there. Still, those aren’t the stories I wish to tell you about. 

The story I want to tell you about is his leadership of a cult, The Order of the Black Rose, intended to elevate African-Americans by worshiping a perfumed cigar-store Indian and whose sister cult only allowed white women to join and then only after they had been weighted in the nude. (Oh, look I buried the lead two paragraphs in)

Knowledge of the cult came to light after DeLaurence told an initiate of The Order of the White Willow that she was, “too fat to be an angel.” 

Now, at the time, there was another more well known cult in the city founded by [Otoman Zar-Adusht Hanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoman_Zar-Adusht_Ha%27nish) founded around Zoroastrianism and fad diets. It continually had issues with the police and press in no small part due to the rumors about the sexual activities they took part in combined with claims it targeted wealth women and young boys. I’m sure everyone can guess what people are going to assume when DeLaurence’s organization comes to light in such an atmosphere. 

After hearing the complaint of Augusta “too fat to be an angel” Murie, the Chicago police raided the headquarters of the Orders and arrested a number of white women, black men, and Delaurence himself for offences under the White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act). This was doubly bad timing as the world heavyweight boxer, Jack Johnson, was awaiting trial for “crimes” under the same act for taking a white woman from Minneapolis to Chicago for “immoral purposes.” 

At trial, the prosecution elected to only go after the orders for fraud, and Murie testified about how DeLaurence had hidden dictographs to record his disciples so he could later pretend to read their minds. DeLaurence was fined $200 and everyone was released. DeLaurence seems to have walked away at this point. 

The cult was supposed to have been disbanded, but in 1923 Helen La Maie said her husband tried to [sell her in exchange for a gambling debt](https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19231207&amp;id=jgAsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HboEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=978,3778385):

history,testudos101,0,5," 

Rome had a special governing system in that there was no definite source that the throne derived its legitimacy from. For example, the United States government derives legitimacy  from the people whereas the chinese dynastic system derived power from the Mandate of Heaven. The Roman emperor had no such source of legitimacy, nor does it have a system for succession (such as the English system of male primogeniture) to smooth the transition of power from emperor to emperor. This led to a huge crisis in the 3rd century when men in power or at the head of an army regularly rebelled and proclaimed himself as emperor.

history,sammyjamez,0,17,"This thought has been in the back of my mind for quite a while due to the fact that throughout my time learning about history, I learned that things were not always what they seemed to be or were not how I was taught long ago like how Columbus never actually set foot on American soil and his reverence as an American hero came much later after the foundation of America as a nation (and it was done by Italian immigrants, not Americans), or how the stories of Nero during the great fire of Rome were probably exaggerated and sensationalist remarks of the tyrant that he was during that time to picture him in a bad image, or how I learned that the Greco-Persian war and the Peloponnesian War were not that black and white as I was told before, or how I once taught that the Roman Enpire actually ended after the fall of Rome during the 4th Century but actually still existed as the Byzantine Empire (at least the historians call it that because the Byzantines still called themselves Romans) till the 15th Century. 

All of these were either the results of misinformation (whether intentional or not; possible bias or perhaps propaganda (like Herodotus, the father of history, is also known as the father of lies (at least, that was what he was known for at a time) becuase at was later found in the Histories, some connotations were either false or make-believe); or where some facts or evidence were re-arranged in a manner that people viewed as what was fit for them or how they saw it (like The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon where he glorified the legacies and the actions that the Western Roman Empire left behind that impacted Europe but completely neglected the Byzantine Empire); or where there are historical information that you find in plenty of books, articles and websites and are treated as fact or valid but later investigations or later insight of other perspectives of a certain event with say otherwise (like for example, there is a online comic that depicts as Nikola Tesla as a greatest and misunderstood genius who ever lived. I even believed that too until I encountered a detailed article (I think it was on reddit as well, I cannot remember) that debunked the whole article and treated it as rhetoric. Or another example is when later investigations found that the pyramids were probably built by paid workers, not by slaves)

Sometimes perceptions of historical events have influenced other areas like works of art like the story of Nazi Germany and WW2 have influenced the moulding of the archetype of the crazy army and fanatical dictator stereotype that wants to conquer the world for the sake of world domination or fanaticism regardless of the history that led to it or the factors that influenced in the background that led to it. Or how current perceptions of history can influence how we view historical events from the current 21st century perspective which can hinder us from fully understanding how it was at that time like for example our views towards imperialism vs how imperialism was practiced beforehand and why;, or how certain civilisations get more attention over others (this is something that puzzles me actually) while the others are neglected and their legacies and influences are hindered from being recognised, explored or even given the attention for whatever secrets they may hold (like for example Damascus steel or the Nazca lines of Peru)

Another question comes to mind regarding bias and perception - how can we know if such a thing was actually how it was described or not? As a certain event truly a big deal at that time or did the historians think or treat it as a big deal? (For example, I want to take into context of a random event that happened a while ago involving the blue-black vs white-gold dress. The internet treated it as a big deal but was it truly a big deal? Will historians in the future treat it as such? And this makes me wonder about historical events like for example was it actually a very big deal when the rest of Europe learned about Columbus or was it a big deal for the rest of the Europe when the western Roman Empire fell or when Constantinople fell considering that it was still technically Roman even though it was a shadow of its former self at that time?)

There are plenty of people involved here - historians who have to examine the perspectives of the people who wrote these histories, whether it is from other books, letters, drawings, diaries and so on; then you have the people themselves who even wrote these stories in the beginning which could differ in context, description, accuracy or exaggeration; then you have the authors of the history books, the academic articles, the websites and the forums online, and then you have the teachers and the students who learn and teach what they know and spread the message along. 

So obviously, then it comes to histography and passing those histories along, there is a possibility that errors might come up, perhaps a person understood the story in a different way, or when passing the story by word of mouth could lead ommission/addition/change of certain details, translations from different languages can lead to possible inaccurate mistranslations as different language may not have the exact word of every word from another language or certain words or phrases could interpreted differently, and so on and so forth. 

It sounds like a big thought where I am probably jumping to conclusions without knowing the answers but it is something that makes me think and sometimes even worry when misinformation is spread around treated as valid or factual","When it comes to histography, how can historians, authors and even the readers of the histories be aware of the accuracy of the histories that they read and write?",2019-07-08 10:15:08

Everyone knows the story of Hitler's aspiration to become a great painter prior to WW1, a dream that shattered with him being denied admission to the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (probably because of his art being considered by the admission officer(s) (or the Academy's equivalent) as ""mediocre"" or ""unoriginal,"" which would have stood him no chance in a very competitive applicant pool).

&amp;#x200B;

Some people like to discuss this anecdote of Hitler's life as a ""what-if.""  Say, if Hitler was accepted into the academy, somehow, would he not embark on the extremist and violent path we all remember him now for?  Could World War 2 not have had happened (at least the World War 2 we know), and world history be very different accordingly?

&amp;#x200B;

That is all very intriguing - at least in my view - to think about.  However, I am more curious about whether said ""what-if"" ever occurred in the minds of the people who rejected Hitler's application.  Assuming that 1) any of the admission officers who reviewed Hitler's application material lived up to at least the end of World War 2 and 2) they did not support Hitler or aligned with his ideology, did they ever came forward and voice their regret via interview, writing, etc.?","Was it ever known if the people who rejected Hitler's application to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, later in retrospect regretted their decision in light of Hitler's later actions?",2019-07-07 03:29:29

history,grigoritheoctopus,0,30,"I just finished this book. It is incredible (and incredibly disturbing). It should be required reading for everyone (especially the final chapter), especially as there are currently concentration camps being run by the US government (and funded by the citizens of the US) in operation throughout the country. 

It documents the actions of the titular battalion as they commit mass shootings, ghetto-clearings, and deportation actions throughout their assigned district in Poland during 1942 and 1943. By Browning’s estimation (supported, in part, by the meticulous records kept by the unit), they ended up shooting at least 38,000 people and facilitated the deportation (to Treblinka) of at least 45,000 more. 

The book seeks to understand why ordinary people are able to participate in genocide. It does so by using post-war interviews from members of the battalion as well as official reports and other primary sources from the war years and examining these through different lenses (psychological explanations, economic motivations, etc.). 

Here are a couple of quotes that give a sense of the answer as to how/why people are capable of committing such horrific actions: 

“A number of explanations have been invoked in the past to explain [why people are able to commit/facilitate genocide]: wartime brutalization, racism, segmentation and routinization of the task, special selection of the perpetrators, careerism, obedience to orders, deference to authority, ideological indoctrination, and conformity. These factors are applicable in varying degrees, but non without qualification” (p. 159).

“The collective behavior of Reserve Police Battalion 101 has deeply disturbing implications. There are many societies afflicted by traditions of racism and caught in the siege mentality of war or threat of war. Everywhere society conditions people to respect and defer to authority, and indeed could scarcely function otherwise. Everywhere people seek career advancement. In every modern society, the complexity of life and the resulting bureaucratization and specialization attenuate the sense of personal responsibility of those implementing official policy. Within virtually every social collective, the peer group exerts tremendous pressures on behavior and sets moral norms. If the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 could become killers under such circumstances, what group of men cannot?” (P. 189)

All of those conditions resonate with me as I look at the state of the world. Books like this one underscore the vital importance of history in guiding us during challenging present times in the hope of creating a better future. 

It’s a cliché but it’s true: we must learn from history in order to avoid committing the same mistakes over and over again.

history,mrtracyalan,0,5,"Rather than a corruption of nature by prehistoric humans or an enlightened scheme in pursuit of progress, the Neolithic Revolution was an uncoordinated, multi-generational effort to survive in the dynamic, often hostile environments of the Near East. It was not sudden or centrally planned; instead, it was defined by advances in agriculture and animal husbandry over thousands of years by people throughout the Near East. So why do we persist in labeling it a revolution?

Evidence of planting of wild crops among the Natufian people in the Levant puts a date for incipient cultivation at c. 9000 BCE.^(1) Two millennia later at ‘Ain Ghazal, agriculture had advanced little and supplemented hunting, which was a primary food source for the site.^(2) Technology didn’t sufficiently advance to support farming solely via irrigation until Samarran settlements of northern Mesopotamia c. 5600–5300 BCE.^(3) These long  gaps imply a lack of coordinated effort and sharing of technology to promote rapid advance; in other words, this was not a fully conceived revolution in Neolithic minds. The priority for Neolithic people was survival, not developing agricultural technology—hence the extended chronology of the “revolution” and why its progress varied across the Near East.

In addition to sites in the Levant including Jericho and ‘Ain Ghazal, we see first traces of sheep herding and non-native plant cultivation at Zawi Chemi in the Zagros Mountains.^(4) To the west in Anatolia, Çatal Höyük used irrigation to feed a growing population c. 6000 BCE.^(5) The dispersal of these Neolithic sites reflects local populations that exploited the environment as best they could, using technology available to them at the time.

Exchanges with the environment facilitated the Neolithic Revolution, but pre-historic peoples did not necessarily see the environment as a force to be controlled or overcome. On the contrary, the relationship Neolithic people maintained with nature was one of survival. Some inhabitants of Pre-Pottery Neolithic Period C (PPNC) ‘Ain Ghazal reverted to hunting and gathering after shifts in social structure and environment occurred c. 6900 BCE—not because of a principled stand against agriculture or a desire to be closer to nature.^(6) Semi-sedentary settlements like ‘Ain Ghazal and Pre-Pottery Neolithic Period A (PPNA) site Göbekli Tepe reflect intentional alteration of the environment;^(7) in short, settlement dwellers and hunter-gatherers alike simultaneously changed and coexisted within nature.

Assumptions regarding the enlightened progress of early farmers or the iniquity of these agricultural developments hold little relevance when examining the actual circumstances of Near East Neolithic peoples. The real and immediate challenges of survival compelled interactions with nature and yielded incremental, uncoordinated advances that were significant, though hardly the sudden and intentional turn conjured by the term revolution.

In movies, even in supposedly huge battles, we are actually only shown a few thousands troops (at most) during those aerial shots from above, and they always look like a compact single group of men. Trying to visualize how armies of 15, 50 or even 100 thousands soldiers would actually look is pretty difficult and crazy, I imagine that in a moving column they would occupy miles and miles of roads, withouth counting all the supply wagons and stuff, and in a campal battle they would stretch to the horizon.

So getting back to the original question: while I can imagine all those troops setting up huge camps in the open, I can't visualize 10-15k soldiers stashed behind the walls of a (smaller) medieval city with no big open spaces. Did they camped in streets, or city squares? did they occupy the invididual homes of the inhabitants? where they always armed and ready to fight off an attack?

history,clydou,0,5,"Hello everyone !

So this is a story that has never been published and that might be unique in the history of WWI, and it's my first time sharing it somewhere. A few years ago I found a few postcards albums in an old barn in the countryside of France, postcards that were dated from 1890 to 1930 more or less. The story behind this is that the family who had these postcards was actually some kind of crazy old people who used to steal postcards from old mailbox, when it used to be a public yellow PO box in the street. So the albums are actually full of hundreds of postcards from random people who send news to their families.

So of course, this postcard has never be read by the addressee, and by anyone else.

Here is the translation of the text of the postcard :

""**29 of august of 1918. My dear Quilecaille (family name).**

**So is it working for the extension? I do not know if Devallet has returned a second time, I am going to write him. I believe I will receive a medal, I found a way with my fire pump to drown a boche** ***(insult for German)*** **bombing aircraft from 9000m away in air, that right there is some nice work. You will see this in the newspaper (le Petit Parisien) except there won’t be my name, there will simply be M. X. Anyway I am on it. I wish you health and soon the end of the war.

This allowed even illiterate churchgoers in those places to understand Catholicism, making them harder to sway by Protestants.

At first, the claim made sense to me. But then it dawned on me ""*Why didn't Protestantism catch on in Ireland or Poland, since their languages aren't mutually intelligible with Latin?*"". Also, to say that the Reformation was an ""outgrowth of Germanic cultures"" disregards the large numbers of Germanic Catholics in Austria, Bavaria, Switzerland and Belgium.

So why did the Reformation catch on where it did? 

* Was it just due to the stances of governments? If so, why did certain governments, such as those of Italian city-states, Spain, Portugal, France and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth stick with Catholicism?

* How come some regions were able to strongly resist conversion to the religion of its government? For example:

   * Most Irish stayed Catholic despite being under Protestant British rule

   * Most Ukrainians stayed Orthodox despite being under Catholic Polish-Lithuanian rule

   * Most Poles stayed Catholic despite being under Orthodox Russian rule

   * Most Dutch remained Protestant despite being under Catholic Spanish rule

* [Johann Gutenberg's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gutenberg) 
[Printing Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_Press) is often credited for the spread of the Protestant Reformation. 

   * Does this mean that had another European nation invented the printing press first, they would be bound to be the starting place of the Protestant Reformation? 

   * Was there really a correlation between literacy and the spread of Protestantism?

&amp;#x200B;

a couple of weeks ago I saw a post by a guy on here, who was asking how retreating worked in the ancient times.

Now I was wondering, how long did medieval battles usually last. I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with the battles shown in hollywood movies (e.g. Braveheart, where people swing swords, hit armor and cut through limbs without a problem).

 Especially the fact that a lot of armies were composed of levy troops, so I'm assuming the following things about them, please correct me if I'm wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

\- only very few troops had training, military expertise and knew how to fight

\- morale was generally low, as you were fighting wars for your feudal lord/king

\- fighting one on one, or against muliple enemies, especially in close quarters is very tiring business, so once you used your weapon for more than lets say 1 hour, you would become very tired and morale would lower even more. (Of course depending on the whole status of the battle).

\- the equipment of most drafted (levy) soldiers would be of very poor quality

I did some research and it seems they used airburst and aimed their shots which is made a lot easier by having targets move at a constant speed and heading.

history,JuicyLittleGOOF,0,9,"The Tollense valley battle is the oldest evidence of a large scale battle in Europe, dating to 1300-1200 BC. It was quite brutal, casualties are estimated to be 750 to 1000 and the total amount of warriors would have been around 4000 men. You can read more about it [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250308033_A_Bronze_Age_Battlefield_Weapons_and_Trauma_in_the_Tollense_Valley_north-eastern_Germany) or [here](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/slaughter-bridge-uncovering-colossal-bronze-age-battle) if you prefer the TLDR version, as well as look at images of the bones and weaponry. Arrows embedded in bones, cracked skulls, bronze spear tips and wooden clubs were all found at this site. Some arrowheads were bronze while others were flint. Evidence of mounted combat has been found as well at this site.

What is interesting to me is that the battle seemed to happen at a border point between three newly emerging cultures; the Proto-Germanic peoples from the Nordic Bronze Age, The Urnfield culture that seems ancestral to the Celtic peoples and the Lusatian culture, a pre-Slavic culture which lived in what is now Poland. Genetic testing showed that the people who fought at this place were quite diverse, some people clustering with modern Scandinavians, some with central and southern Europeans and some with modern day Poles, I think this correlates quite well with the cultural regions. Isotropic evidence has shown that some people who died at this battle grew up eating millet, which was not a common crop in northern Europe at the time.

Some of the findings at this battle were not weapons, but golden and tin spiraled rings. [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250308166_Bronze_Age_tin_rings_from_the_Tollense_valley_in_Northeastern_Germany) is another publication from researchgate which discusses these rings in detail. I do not think these were ornamental, but rather ingots, and this publication seems to agree with me.

The Urnfield culture originated in Southern Germany and Austria, which are rich in metal ores, Tin in particular occurs in the Ore mountains which is on the Border of Saxony and Bohemia. I think this is why the Celtic culture was so widespread in early central Europe, as they had access to a lot copper and tin, which means that you can make bronze. Which is really good for trading, and it probably gave birth or accelerated their warrior elite social classes.

So essentially these Proto-Celts were the cool new kids on the block, with fancy shiny armor, weapons and ornaments. These people would go around and trade, and other people thought they were cool and wanted to be like them, so they did. This brings me to the Lusatians, the pre-Slavic Poles.

The Lusatians were heavily influenced by the Urnfield culture, as their ancestors, the Trzciniec (I had to google that), traded with the predecesors of the Urnfield culture, the Tumulus, which ultimately gave rise to the Lusatian cultures.

The third people in this story were the people of the Nordic Bronze Age, or the Proto-Germanic people. The ancestors of the Germanic tribes that would plague the Gauls, the Romans, the Britons, and not to mention the Norse, who raided across the entire world. Despite what the Romans, Arabs or the recently converted Anglo-Saxons and Franks would have you believe, the Germanic tribes were not just a bunch of brooding dumb barbarians and neither were their ancestors. The NBA people had extensive trade with both the Lusatians and the Urnfield cultures, since bronze artefacts are commonly found but tin had to be imported. We know that centuries later, the climate in Scandinavia seems to get tougher and since there already was limited farmland, these Germanic tribes start migrating southwards and push the Celtic peoples back.

so here is what I think happened:

A big trading caravan from southern central Europe makes it way up north to trade with the Lusatians. These were dangerous times, especially since Indo-European societies loved to raid for some reason. This caravan is therefore well protected by mercenaries from different parts of the Celtic sphere, some of them mounted on horseback. Professional soldiers with bronze weaponry. This trading caravan is travelling north to trade metals like gold, tin and bronze, and probably return with amber and furs, maybe slaves too. But while crossing the Tollense river, this caravan gets attacked by a giant warband of marauders, hailing from the north. These Proto-Germanic people probably were the ones responsible for the wooden clubs and flint arrowheads, although I do think the wealthier individuals had bronze weaponry with them.

Unfortunately not enough evidence has been found to indicate who won or lost this battle, however the amount of bronze weaponry we find is quite low. No swords have been found yet marks clearly made by swords have, so someone must have taken the swords from the battlefield. The bodies were also dumped into the river so I think it was pretty clear that they were pillaged after the battle. I do not think a big trading caravan in foreign land which just got attacked by a giant group of raiders would have any interest in collecting the bronze weaponry spread over the battlefield, but the people who attacked with flint arrowheads and wooden clubs would. But who knows, swords were pretty expensive at the time so maybe the figured it was best to at least bring back the swords since the trading excursion did not seem to work out.

This battle is really fascinating to me because I think that the battle probably set the stage for the early history of northern and central Europe. A prequel to the Germanic expansions into Celtic, and later, Roman lands.

After the city walls fell and the Ottomans were busy plundering there were some areas of resistance. Some escaped by ship as Turkish sailors were afraid of missing out on looting but also:

""A small company of Cretan sailors held out in three towers near the entrance of the Golden Horn until early afternoon. They so won the admiration of the Turks that they were allowed to leave the city unharmed"".

Does anyone have more details and / or references for the Cretans?

The only thing I can find is [this post](https://agiosvasileiospeiraiws.blogspot.com/2010/05/fall-of-constantinople-1453-by.html) and it only mentions that Venice allowed the Byzantines to recruit Cretan soldiers and sailors, ""who acted heroically during the siege"", and mentioned:

"" The Cretan soldiers and sailors, manning three towers near the entrance of the Golden Horn, were still fighting and had no intention of surrendering.

history,CuriousastheCat,0,3,"Back in university I always used to start by reading the primary sources, then secondary, then usually loop back to primary. Having less time for the looping part of this now, I was wondering if people tend to start reading about a topic/period with primary sources or contextualise them (and understand their limitations etc.) first by reading secondary sources.

&amp;#x200B;

There's something very attractive about starting with the primary source to me: is somehow feels more authentic and if it has literary interest in its own right you get the full experience without 'spoilers'. But primary sources can be heavier going and occasionally somewhat impenetrable, so the risk is that you read it all without understanding some underlying concept (or worse, imposing some false understanding derived from Rome Total War or something).

&amp;#x200B;

I think my own conclusion in practice ends up being that whatever order it's in I need a clear and reasonably vivid narrative to hang things off to take on more detailed information: if I think the primary sources will give that I start there, otherwise with secondary (sometimes pretty simplistic secondary sources rather than deep analysis just to get the outlines).

Hi all, I was wondering if any of you might be able to help. In the hierarchy of things, the Empress is the 'first wife' of an Emperor. She is from a high-ranking background. This is followed by the other consorts and then by the concubines who might be from a lowly/common background.

From what I have read so far and according to a discussion I had with some friends, I understand that the emperor is not allowed to have other women before the empress and he is not allowed to have other children without first having consummated the marriage with the Empress?

I went into this discussion thinking that consorts are basically concubines and are not legally married to the Emperor and that the only legal marriage is with the Empress. Sure an emperor might love the consort but he doesn't have the power to make her an Empress because she is from a lowly background. Also, this makes all children that the Emperor has with his consorts/concubines illegitimate.

It's a bit confusing and I'm no expert so these are my questions:

* Can an emperor have a child with a female consort without having married an Empress? \[So basically he has a child with a female consort FIRST and then after the child is born he decides to marry a high-ranking woman and name her Empress instead of the female consort.\]
* Since the emperor can't marry the female consort because she's from a lowly/common background, when the child from this consort is born, will he/she belong to the Empress because of the legal marriage? Or how does it work?

I have already found what aircraft were used on the Carriers Yorktown and Lexington during the battle but I am particularly interested in the composition of their Fighter, Bomber, and Torpedo Squadrons.

For some background, I have already accessed the bulk of the USN's archives on both of the above listed Carrier Air Wings (both were established in 1938) but can find no information prior to 1950. I understand that because all of these original documents were physical, there is some chance that they have not been digitally archived to the fullest extent.

For those wondering, the argument came up after some presumably americans said the proto-typical ""we saved EU by winning WWII"" 


The argument was mostly that by the time the Americans troops got involved Russia was already gearing up and as the Axis overextended into the East the Russians *pushed* and would have been entirely successful without any of the western theater due to their sheer military might (given, mostly in numbers). According to those giving this argument, this is essentially what was taught in primary European history education, that even if America had not been involved Russia still would have won against the Axis powers. As an American who was taught essentially that we won WWII, this argument, while theoretically making sense, doesn't sound right considering the scale of the French/Africa/Italy campaigns and the amounts of troops, generals, and munitions dedicated to the west.

history,mrtracyalan,0,9,"The nature of games as an interactive medium provides the right conditions for counterfactual historical scenarios. These are unintentionally fictive visions of historical experience counter to our understanding of the evidence. In some cases, counterfactuals in games are quite troublesome and inhibit comprehension of historical concepts. In *Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey* by Ubisoft, the player is presented with a choice: with the Athenian or Spartan armies lined up face-to-face, you must decide which to join; but, you are free to kill soldiers in either army before making your decision, at which point you are welcomed without any reference to the murders just committed.

Such scenarios are laughable and make for good YouTube videos, but they do little to cultivate understanding of the lived experience of Greek warriors. This does not mean counterfactuals are without value, as they  empower players to engage with historical narratives in ways not possible with passive consumption of scholarship. The challenge is to facilitate counterfactual engagement that grants some freedom of choice to the player for exploration, but retains enough focus on historical concepts so as to structure the formation of cultural memory and historical understanding.",The Usefulness of Counterfactuals in Historical Games,2019-06-27 16:58:30

 Example Below

## Portuguese Man at War

This is the name given to a very dangerous species of jelly fish. The real reason behind it resides in how well equipped this creature is, and is a comparison to the way the Portuguese ships fought in India.  


Vice-Roy of India, **D. Afonso de Albuquerque**, a military genius of the highest degree commanded a fleet of six ships manned by four hundred men, and entered Ormuz Bay, being surrounded by 250 warships and a 20.000 men army on land ready to dispatch the small Portuguese flotilla.

When the **King of Ormuz** sent aboard an emissary to question Albuquerque, the great Commander told the messenger one phrase: **Surrender yourselves !!!**

This must have provoked an inner laugh from the messenger who left.

When the battle begun, **Albuquerque** made his fleet circle like a carrousel and destroyed most of the ships. He then proceeded to conquer Ormuz with 400 men.

How could this be achieved one must ask. The technical explanation may make some sense, but will not explain the courage of taking such a risk.

In fact we all know that during the U.S.Civil War, canons had to be loaded from their mouths. This was in the XIX Century. However Albuquerque’s canons were equipped with breeches that did not require the canons to be brought backwards to be loaded. It meant that while the enemy’s canons fired a shot, the Portuguese canons could fire six with a range of 1.800 meters against 700 meters of the enemy’s canons. The next issue is that the Portuguese artillery men had discovered the propulsive effect of water. If you throw a stone at a low angle near the surface of the water, the stone will be propelled by the water’s surface and gain more speed.

The second row of canons were placed very near the floating line and the stronger fire power was further enhanced by the water effect, causing the steel balls to not only hit the ship but hit the one behind the first one. Being fired at close to the floating line, the ships would start sinking very fast.

Then one must be aware that the Portuguese knew they were always outnumbered, a certainty that led them to employ all their courage and determination in the fights and battles they engaged.

In many cases, just mentioning the Portuguese would distress an entire army or fleet, knowing the fierceness and bravery of the Portuguese warriors.",Portuguese War Results,2019-06-24 17:30:49

Or was white used because it was the color of the powder itself? In that case, if they had pink powder and purple powder, why couldn’t the powder also be black?

Or was it that the hair used to make the wig was already white to begin with? Come to think of it, what was the hair sourced from? If it was derived from some natural fiber, I guess it might make sense if the only color option was a white or off-white shade. But surely that could also be dyed some different color.

history,pubgbridgeword,0,20,"My list (it’s similar to most people’s with the top 4):


1. Alexander the Great- Ik many people criticize his ability by attributing his victories to him having a powerful army, but imo Macedonian and Persian armies are closer in ability than people normally believe. Macedonian infantry was leagues better but it was vulnerable in obstacles for example the rivers at Issus and Granicus which Alex still won. I’d like to also point out that Persians also had good Greek mercenaries. When it comes to cavalry, imo Gaugamela proves that Persians had quality cavalry, despite having more than the Macedonians. But other than that, Alex killed a massive empire in 4 years and he has incredible battle tactics, evident by him not losing a single battle. 


2. Napoleon Bonaparte- Conquered most of western Europe after all the other powers declared war on him and brought most of them to their knees. He also fought 60 battles only losing 8 and also implemented the corps system very effectively.

3.(tie) Hannibal Barca- Although many people say he’s a bad strategist, I don’t anyone could’ve done better against Rome at the time. When it comes to tactics, I think he’s the best here for obvious reasons. 

3.(tie) Julius Caesar- Conquered Gaul and won the Civil War against incredible odds. He was very good at strategy, tactics, and logistics.

5. John Churchill, 1st duke of Marlborough- Was amazing at everything, won some incredible battles, and never lost a single one. 

6. Subutai- In the end, he won against everyone he fought, he defeated his enemies and was very fast.

7. Jan Zizka- He was blind, and he defeated imperial armies with his peasant army while outnumbered and never lost a single battle.

8. Khalid ibn al-walid- He fought a lot of battles and only lost once, and he destroyed Byzantine armies time and time again. I would’ve put him higher if the Byzantine army was actually good and if Muslim sources didn’t exaggerate enemy numbers.

9. Scipio Africanus- Great strategist who conquered spain and defeated Hannibal and Carthage.

10. Arthur Wellesly, 1st duke of Wellington- He fought great battles in India, defeated Napoleonic France in Spain, and went on to defeat Napoleon himself, although he got lucky.


You may have noticed that I didn’t put Genghis Khan, but that’s because he didn’t fight the battles himself(at least not to my knowledge), but he was easily a better strategist than anyone here.",Who are your top 5 or 10 military commanders of all time?,2019-06-23 17:18:42

Antony Beevor calls much of this realpolitik in FDR’s mind to create the groundwork for the UN, but Richard Overy cites in *Why the Allies Won* that FDR wasn’t above letting his personal biases get in the way of foreign affairs, as he apparently had a strong dislike of German people, which might have influenced his initial desire to turn Germany into an industrially neutered country.

One of my friends is encouraging me to get the DLCs, so I watched the trailers. In the trailer for [*The Cossacks*](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/The_Cossacks) DLC, [it was an animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGWWB3OH3uQ) about the [Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks).

* On one hand, the [Cossacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks) definitely refused to submit to Turkish rule, and they probably would have sent a reply to Sultan Mehmed IV when he demanded their submission.
* On the other hand, why didn't the Ottomans keep any record of whatever reply was sent to them by the Zaporozhian Cossacks? After all, the Ottomans had a highly literate court and a strong bureaucratic tradition. 
* Finally, considering the nomadic nature of the Cossacks, does this mean that there were very few literate Cossacks?

But did the Ottomans and Tatars only partake in slave trading to obtain sex slaves Janissaries, or were there other purposes they were used for?:

* Was there an abolitionist movement among the Ottomans or the Tatars?
* Did the Ottoman/Tatar slave trade create a situation like in the Roman Empire and the CSA where the free citizens who couldn't afford slaves were screwed?:

history,wjbc,0,3,"I’m reading *SPQR*, a Roman history by classicist Mary Beard, and I love it.  I come into it after reading *The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* (1776-1789), by Edward Gibbon, and *The History of Rome* (1854-56), by Theodor Mommsen.  I knew they were likely out of date as pure history, and I'm enjoying Beard's more rigorous historical account.

I still recommend Gibbon and Mommsen, though, and I wanted to explain why.  Both Gibbon and Mommsen are great storytellers and very revealing of the mindset of their respective times and countries — Gibbon at the onset of the British Empire, Mommsen at the onset of the Prussian Empire.  Both looked to Rome for a model, but drew very different lessons.

Gibbon, living in a country with a history of internal religious conflict, admired the iron rule of great pagan emperors like Marcus Aurelius, and sought the continued separation of church and state and strong rulers chosen by merit.  Aurelius and his four predecessors were all chosen by merit and adopted by the previous emperor.

Mommsen, on the other hand, living in a “Germany” with a long history of division into small states, was more interested in the fall of the Roman Republic and the rise of Julius Caesar.  Mommsen did not mourn the Republic, admiring the strong ruler who could create an empire out of bloody factional chaos.  Yet both Gibbon and Mommsen interpreted history for their own purposes, with an agenda that rendered their tales suspect.

Beard does a great job of separating legend from fact.  She also tries to look at the life of ordinary people, including many slaves, although that’s not easy when there were no biographies written about them.  She points out that for ordinary people during the 200+ years the empire was at its height, it did not seem to matter much who was emperor.

It does not seem clear to her that the bad emperors were as bad as advertised (usually to justify their assassination), or the great emperors as great as advertised (lauded by their chosen successors), or that any emperors were even as important as advertised (by Roman historians who often had their own agendas).  Beard has the modern skepticism of the Great Man Theory of History previously accepted without question by ancient Roman historians and many 18th and 19th century historians.  I'm just getting to the part where Beard looks at how the empire \*really\* ran, almost regardless of who was emperor -- a study of the Roman bureaucracy.","On Beard, Gibbon, Mommsen, and Roman history writing.",2019-06-17 18:00:01

So for starters, don't get your history from Age of Empires 2. But here's what the Conqueror's manual said about the Spanish unique tech Supremacy:

*""""The peasants of Spain lived especially hard lives in an era when life was not easy for anyone. The difference was that Spain was a battleground for much of the Middle Ages as the Christian kingdoms in the north strived to reconquer the peninsula from Saracens who had invaded in the 8th century. Spanish peasants were therefore also warriors part of the time. This was a fact that the French army under Napoleon would learn the hard way in the early 19th century.""*

So obviously, Age of Empires 2 makes the claim that Spanish peasants lived especially difficult lives and that this is mostly due to Moorish occupation. Is this substantiated, and if it is, did other conditions contribute to the claimed poor living conditions?

 “...runaways were defined as various types, they were truants (who usually returned voluntarily), “outlaws”... and slaves who were actually fugitives: men who visited relatives, went to town to pass as free, or tried to escape slavery completely...”

In the next paragraph of the book after the quote, it again says 

“slaves born in America, on the other hand, were more likely to run off alone, and, with the skills they had learn on the plantation, try to pass as free men.”

My question is how prevalent were free black people in the colonies. I was completely unaware that blacks were even able to get freedom in the colonies considering they were shipped over from Africa specifically to become slaves.

history,Sgt-Spliff,0,9,"So this may seem like more of an opinion question, but I’d very much like to hear someone more knowledgeable tell me what is wrong or right about this thought I’ve been having lately:

I often see lists of great leaders that include the titans of history: Washington, Augustus, Bismarck, etc.

But also on those lists usually are Napoleon, Alexander the Great, sometimes even Hitler because he commanded “the largest European empire since Napoleon” (I’ve read that exact line at least 10 times this most recent semester in a WWII class).

But this second list always rubbed me the wrong way. Alexander was never a ruler, he was a conqueror who never transitioned to civilian politics to my knowledge. Hitler and Napoleon definitely put more effort into civilian rule, but even then, it was just to fund their wars. All of these men’s gains were also lost almost immediately upon their death or defeat. Besides the traumatization of entire generations, it seems the only outcome of some of these massive war empires is that they expanded and contracted at break neck speeds, and do nothing but cause chaos for the common people. From my perspective, the “empires” of Alexander, Napoleon, and Hitler built were nothing like the real greatest empires: Rome, the Mongols, etc. These lasted generations upon generations.

So my question is: What’s the historical consensus on how much these second guys compare as “rulers”, ranking them in an all-around general sense against the longer lasting dynasties?

In almost every culture, it seems that there have been different classes, with some being more powerful than others. Additionally, there have been many classes of nobility that have existed independently of the governing class. What are the different ways these groups have obtained their relative power over time?

As an example, ancient Egypt had a centralized command economy, and a noble class. Did these nobles still somehow own land? I think there are many other questions that flow from that one alone. How did people acquire wealth in different cultures and economic models over time? 

Are there even other ways that some groups gained social power, independent of wealth? This might open up a deeper question. How do historians define power? How do they define nobility?

I understand the production was co-funded by the Soviet Union and Italy.. what is going on with that relationship? why would the Italian and Soviet states co-fund a film production, surely at the time of filming (1969/70) the relations between NATO Italy and the Soviet Union were a bit more frosty?

This strategy would last untill, of course, the offensive of Caporetto where the situation on the Alpine front would become extremely different.

the first thing that stands out to me is Britain's decision to defend Belgium's neutrality and enter the war against the Germans. in the previously mentioned texts the British politicians discuss the notion that major European war could disrupt the current balance of power and potentially end unfavourably for them. If Germany was to defeat Russia/France they would have massive influence over the political realm and challenge Britain position as greatest power. Was this the right decision to make tho. Britain would suffer extremely high casualties in the war the rattled their political system and arguably the decline of the British empire and the passing of the torch to the USA as super power. I know its easy to look back in hindsight but this was an issue that always seem to stick with me. 

The second problem was the extreme damage to the German reputation caused by the invasion of Belgium. However overblown this issue was i feel the Germans suffered an extreme blow to their chances based off this alone. This was something that was hard for me to believe considering how obsessive the German generals were over not being named the instigator of the war in the preliminary stages.

My thinking is: Mainly because the war goals of both conflicts basically remained the same. The two principal conflicts in both were Austro-Prussian conflict over Germany (specifically Silesia) and the Anglo-French conflict overseas. When the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was signed in 1748, everyone knew it would be merely a truce, it solved no issues, and was only signed out of pure exhaustion. The threat of war constantly loomed, causing the dramatic shake-up of the alliances during 1755-1756. 

Some point to the 8-year peace between, but what is the point of peace where we can divide wars into two separate occasions. During the ""Hundred Years War"" England and France had truces lasting nearly 20 years at some points, but we consider that the same conflict. So what difference was an 8-year truce make?

Lastly, the reversal of alliances. 1.) Alliance reversals happen all the time in warfare. And 2.) The switch-up occured because of the previous war and its goals. Austria and France realizing that they were not each others main threats allied to combat the alliance signed between their two greatest enemies. 

That's my evidence, I'm curious as to what yall think. I love having conversations like this, but unfortunately no one I know around here knows enough (or cares) about this topic. Thanks!!",Was 1740-1763 a 23 year long war? Or two separate conflicts?,2019-06-13 06:06:45

&amp;#x200B;

(Longer story) I was playing a mod (Floris) for the game 'Mount and Blade: Warband'. For those who don't know what this game is about (I highly recommend it for gamers), it's a medieval RPG where you build a character, recruit lower ranked troops, fight battles and gain experience for you and your party. Depending on who you recruit, these troops can branch off (In a 'Troop Tree') to become different types of fighters. You can build an army of heavy infantry units, a fast moving cavalry or highly accurate archers depending on how you feel. It's an AWESOME game with cool fighting mechanics and a great story line that you can essentially build yourself. A nod to the historical accuracy of the game is included at the beginning, stressing the fact that if you choose a female character to start, you will have limitations.  Anyways, among the recruits you can take into your army are women.  These women start out like all other recruits, wearing simple farming clothes and carrying improvised weapons. But as they expand, they join different classes, including 'Women Militia, Amazon, Jungfrau and Truus te Paard'. So after seeing this, I started to wonder... Were there any groups or classes of warriors in any culture, throughout history, that only included women? Like I said before, any search on Google only gets results about individual female warriors that were famous. I get it, in many cultures throughout history in the world, women were not expected or considered to become warriors. But I've still heard of groups like 'Shield Maidens', (Which after researching have discovered that their existence is still debated, because no accurate historical evidence has shown that they were actually a thing) so I was wondering if there were any more examples of this.

As far as i understand chainmail first appears around the 5th century BC being developed by Celts or other ethnic barbarian groups inhabiting central Europe and the Balkans, it was prevalent in both the barbarian cultures and was quickly adopted by the Romans being used extensively pretty much throughout the entire Roman period and beyond, the Romans and the various Persian Empires which existed during late antiquity used chainmail heavily and obviously even after the fall of the Western Roman Empire chainmail would remain the most popular form of forged armour until the 14th century AD in Western Europe.

I'm not sure how early the Chinese would have been introduced to chainmail or even if they independently developed it and disgarded it previously, but considering it is known that Han Dynasty China and the Romans/Sassanids had established diplomatic relations and trade existed between Europe/Near East and China as early as 140AD why didn't chainmail become as prevalent in China as it did in Europe?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: i should preface this question by saying that Chain Mail is rarely depicted in artwork or representations of ancient China, my question really boils down to, assuming chainmail is introduced to Han period China around 140Ad - why hasn't it taken over completely within a generation considering the benefits which made it so popular in Europe would also apply in Han China.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: So the general consensus seems to be that the prevalence of missile weapons in Chinese warfare (obviously this varied throughout the ages), combined with the type of missile weapons and arrow types used - heavy draw weight composite bows, and crossbows meant mail was not as effective as it was in Europe/Middle East/India and in China they had already developed types of armour (such as Lamellar and Brigandine equivalents) to counter this heavily missile focused war, so while it did see limited use it wasn't adopted wholesale by the Chinese.",Chain Mail in Ancient China,2019-06-11 18:28:36

At Stalingrad the Axis also lost an army group and nearly 800k men but it was in the course of 6 months and the soviets lost 1.1 million men.

There's the battle of Changping also where Qin burried 400k Zhao troops alive but however lost 250k men.

Going by ratio of casualties and lopsided victories contenders would be the Battle of Chaeronea  where Sulla crushed a 120,000 Pontic force at the expense of a few hundred casualties, Minsk where the Germans captured or killed 400k Soviet troops at expense of 12k losses, the battle of Cannae where Rome suffered its greatest defeat ever when it lost 85k troops to Hannibal while only inflicting 6k losses, Cerami where 160 Norman knights killed the bulk of a 300-10000 strong Arab army among many others

But I also thought that the whole controversy died soon after Charlemagne took the title. An interesting idea is that Henry IV had a real problem with the church and had to perform the walk to Canossa. It could be the pope didn’t crown him yet or that the news didn’t reach the Byzantines.

history,AntifaSuprSoldierSid,0,2,"So earlier today, I got a little bored and was reading through a couple of my old books about WW2. And I found this interesting little section in ""Iron Fist: Classic Armoured Warfare Case Studies"", by Bryan Perrett:

https://imgur.com/a/rXiGuGb

In case you can't read it, it describes a gas attack by Japanese troops against British tanks in April of 1942. Two incidents are mentioned: one where a phial is thrown but misses, and one where it is thrown into a Stuart tank ([the phial used in these attacks](http://www.inert-ord.net/jap02h/grenades/tbgas/index.html).)

The whole crew, except for the commander Sgt Campbell, is incapacitated, with Campbell being unscathed as a result of having his head out of the turret during the attack. Campbell then takes back control of the tank, and removes it from the road, before turning it's guns on the site of the ambush. For this action he received a Military Medal.

Naturally, this story peaked my interest. It's fairly odd for one thing: gas was nowhere near as used in combat in WW2 as it had been in WW1, and it's fairly well known that one of the reasons no one broke it out on a large scale for combat purposes, against the other major powers, was due to fear of retaliation. It therefore seems odd that Japanese forces would utilise gas grenades only once, and never bother with them again, as surely if you're going that far you might as well keep it up. 

It's also a bizzare method of disabling a tank, as I'm sure many would agree. Thirdly, there are no citations directly, but it is very specific on the details: 16th April, Sgt Campbell, Burma, Military Medal. These details are the kind of thing that can be checked, so I wanted to.

So now I'm interested. It's a odd story, and I want to know more. I get a couple of my history nerd friends to help me out, and we start to dig deeper. 

First place we find this story replicated, is Tank Tracks to Rangoon, also by Bryan Perrett. [It describes the incident again in a little more detail](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dEURBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%227th+Hussars%22+%22Sgt+Campbell%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivjaGa2NriAhWJThUIHS2NDGwQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%227th%20Hussars%22%20%22Sgt%20Campbell%22&amp;f=false). Same author though, so we can't take it as truth, and it also doesn't give any sources on this incident. We gotta look elsewhere.

Next answer: we go hunting through old newspaper archives, since they'd include this sort of thing. Unfortunately, I failed to make any progress on this front. No mention of our Mr Campbell. 

Eventually, we try going for medal records. [We get to this site.](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/british-military-gallantry-medals/#3-how-to-find-records) We try to find it: no dice. 

We've almost given up by now, but someone points out a name in Tank Tracks To Rangoon: a Lt John Parry, who was the commander of Sgt Campbell. I plug this name into Google with ""Burma"" added in a last ditch hope, and while I don't find any accounts written by him, I do find [something else.](http://www.hut-six.co.uk/WW2data/WO373-Burma%20and%20India.html)

According to the site it's a list of all recommendations for honours given in the region we're looking for. This seems like our place. So we pop in Campbell, and we get... 18 results. Luckily Perrett gave us a fair few details about him so we can sort through them, and we get: Cecil Campbell, a Serjeant in the 7th Hussars who got a Military Medal in 1942. There's also a link to the recommendation, number 0988. 

This takes us to [here.] (https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D7363952) ([for those who for whatever reason can't get into that, here's a screenshot)](https://imgur.com/a/cMuhJIh)

Nothing we didn't know already...but there is an image of the record. If anywhere contains a mention of this incident, it will be the record of the recommendation. Now I could pay £3.50 (??????) to access this without a watermark, but I'm lazy and poor, so that won't happen. Instead, we're gonna do it the hard way.

[For those who want to strain their eyes, a link to the image.](https://imgur.com/a/3Mpz5ZK)

It's not ideal. But you can just read enough. It says: 

""the enemy attacked with gas grenades. All members of the crew except Sgt Campbell, including the driver, were rendered insensible. Although himself feeling sick and giddy, Sgt Campbell climbed into the driver's seat and drove the tank back 100 yards. Sgt Campbell then manned the gun, and in spite of enemy mortar fire, succeeded with his troop leader in inflicting casualties on parties of the enemy in a building and in the open.""

So, that's the story confirmed. Despite it seeming fairly outlandish, and despite (as far as I can tell) only one book covering this incident, it was completely true! 

It's honestly fascinating that this actually occured, and even more so that no one talks about it. Hats off to Perrett for finding it, and thanks must also go to Geoff Sullivan, who is credited with creating the website that allowed me to find his citation. Finally, credit goes to my friends for joining me in such a bizarre search for a small detail in 2 paragraphs of one book.","Guns, Gas and Grenades: my search for an obscure anecdote.",2019-06-08 21:57:20

I engaged in a bit of a thinking exercise as in which country was the strongest country in the World at any one point. This doesn't follow any strict objective criteria, but most of the time, I feel, it is not difficult to identify the strongest entity which in most cases defaults to China. There are times where this might be more difficult to do, like in the period between the years 600 AD and 900 AD. The main guidance I used for myself is territorial size and population size (this holds until the contemporary period, where the power dynamics in the world become different). The chart always gives an event as a reason for change.

This is by no means meant to be an authoritative list but simply a fun exercise for myself. If you disagree please tell me which country you would place as number one at any one point and for what time period. Please also note the following guiding principle of this list: if one country is listed as strongest and in the meantime another country grows to a point where one could reasonably claim that these two are of equal strength (e.g. China (Han / Xin) and the Roman Empire) then the country that was initially number one retains the number one spot until it is confidently surpassed (an example of such is China (Sui) and the ERE).

history,[deleted],0,2,"Firstly, I'm not a history student, I just have an interest. I'm having trouble getting round the almost unbelievable disparity between Celts and other civilisations. It's very strange that whilst Britain had just hill forts, torcs, chariots and weaponry, Alexander was building Alexandria and Rome had the Colosseum. And centuries before the Med world had philosophy and mathematics,  refined ideas from scholars with identifiable faces and personalities. I think that's what I'm feeling. Celts are faceless to a large extent. The book on Celts I'm reading has to go into detail about what 'the Great Torc' looks like from the La Tene period because there's little to go on other than objects and speculations on burial situations, yet thousands of years before we have the Book of the Dead and names of Egyptian rulers. I understand that writing is the main cause of this disparity, but it just seems almost unbelievable to me that the British Isles didn't have writing until Ogham (I believe) in the 400s AD. I mean, you'd think that the Halstatt culture in the 'core' German zone would've had writing of some form, especially since the Hueneburg settlement is considered by some to be a polis... Why didn't any Celts have writing? We're just a bunch of faceless warriors and farmers until the Romans come along. This isn't a piss take, by the way--I'm from the UK. I've just never thought about how severe the gap in technology is. Can someone discuss this in more detail?

Edits: It's not just a gap in technology. It's the whole sort of cultural presence, the way we perceive the Celts compared to, say, Greeks and Romans. Even the Assyrians had more of a cultural impact, and they are far older.

I mean, didn't the Celts also have contact with Etruscans? I find it hard to believe we're so in the dark with them.",Disparity Between Celts and Other Civilisations,2019-06-06 15:04:45

Given those elements, I wonder if the Romans considered the Carthaginians as barbarians.

Roman arrogance and utter contempt for the other cultures and people they encountered and submitted is pretty well documented, and only the hellenes were specifically singled out as non-barbarians (after all, they coined the term, and Romans were huge weeaboos for everything Hellas) and considered more or less equal to the romans.

If Morocco was a major power in the Atlantic, they likely would have helped Spain's colonies become independent or fall into the hands of Native Americans.

Morocco had several advantages in becoming a potential major power in the Atlantic:

* Islam, like Christianity, is a proselytising religion which wants more and more people to convert to it.
* Morocco wasn't a military pushover, as demonstrated by them defeating and killing [King Sebastian of Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_of_Portugal) in battle.
* Morocco's territory extended further West and South than anywhere in Western Europe, giving them less distance to cover to get to South America.
* Morocco was far more technologically advanced than the states of Sub-Saharan West Africa
* The location of Morocco just South of Europe meant that:
   * It won't take too long for European inventions to spread to Morocco.
   * Having a direct land route to the Middle East along the Southern shore of the Mediterranean meant that Middle Eastern inventions wouldn't take too long to spread to Morocco.
* Morocco under [Ismail Ibn Sharif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Ibn_Sharif) was an ally of Great Britain, and continued being an ally for several decades after his death.
* Moroccans did develop sufficient seafaring capability to sail the treacherous waters between Morocco and the Sub-Saharan parts of West Africa.

So why didn't Morocco become a major power in the Atlantic or colonise the Americas?

* Were they prevented from adventurism by domestic troubles?
* Did they lack funds to start colonies?
* Would doing so give European nations a reason to attack Morocco and/or its colonies in the Americas?

history,putdownthreads,0,5,"This is kind of a difficult question to word, so I apologize for any vagueness about this topic, but I will try my best.

From my understanding, Ancient Europe seemed to have a really diverse and broad degree of cultural diversity and technology, from the Celts to Latin Rome to Germanic tribes to Hellenic Greece to the Iberian cultures to the Norse. These cultures all seem very unique and distinct from each other, but as I look more into European history, somewhere along the way I sort of notice that European culture as a whole seems to become increasingly similar, especially during the early modern period, where European culture as a whole seems very uniform (For example, comparing ancient Norway to ancient Spain, they would seem totally alien to each other, but in the early modern periods, they do have their differences but they might seem more alike then different).

Obviously, each nation and people retain a significant amount of independent national and cultural significance, but overall, Europe at some point seems to have gotten rid of the diversity in unique ways of life in favor of homogeneous ideas like urban living, agriculture, firearms-based warfare, etc. Even the clothing for most of Europe seems to become very similar in the early modern period, although there were difference between fashions in countries, from my perspective it seems very similar overall.

Is there any specifiable point where Europe went from these diverse cultures and ways of life into the more homogeneous 'civilized' life we know of now?

history,[deleted],0,5,"Hi,

A history newbie here. I have become interested in Mongol history. I noticed that they were extremely brutal and destructed and conquered a large portion of Asia, the Middle East, India, and Russia.

To me, it seems most of these countries were traumatized afterward. For example, I learned about the Islamic golden age that revived science, philosophy, algebra, and medicine, but afterwards, there is not much contribution from Islamic countries to the world. Also, the rise of communism, fundamentalism, and a generally cynical view about the world exists in this part of the world. It seems these countries lost hope in humanity. They saw the dark side of humanity and to them, any powerful country is a reminder of Genghis Khan.

I was wondering if there is a study on the long term effect of Mongol destruction? To me it seems European do not want to look at the story because it reminds them that most of their success in the last 5 centuries might be due to the elimination of the ancient cultures and their competition due to Mongol wars and Asian and Middle Eastern do not want to look at them, because let's face it they are traumatized and if anything they want to remove that story from their collective psyche.

Now clearly Hitler dominated this negotiation, as Chamberlain accidentally conceded Czech sovereignty over the Sudetenland. 

So therefore was the “blackmail” the fact that Hitler now had Chamberlain on-sides against his own cabinet and allies (France and by proxy Czechoslovakia)? And that hitler could sort of dictate the negotiations from there at further meetings?

Or was the “blackmail” the fact that Chamberlain also admitted to Hitler that he felt making peace was important politically back in Britain, because he felt he had staked his premiership to peace? Because only one party could accept war as a result, this would give Hitler free hand on any peace deal as Chamberlain would essentially be forced to accept any terms proposed (dictated, essentially).

history,creesch,0,6,"Hi! 

As a more serious large subreddit it takes a lot of work to maintain /r/history. This also means that we are always looking to add a few more mods to the /r/history team. 
So we always have a link in our sidebar [to the moderator application page](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/mod_application) so people that are interested in becoming a mod can apply there.
However we also like to every once in a while draw a bit more attention to this process, which is why we made this post. This post gives the same information as on the linked wiki page, but it also allows you to ask questions about being a mod. 

## What do we expect from \/r/history moderators?

Here is a quick overview of the general things we are looking for: 

- **Experienced with reddit and \/r/history:** We are looking for experienced redditors who have been active on reddit with an account that is at least 1 year old. In addition to that we are looking for people who have contributed productively to this community. 
- **A firm interest in history:** We want people that are interested in the subject, so obviously you need to have a firm interest in history. 
- **Communicative towards users and fellow moderators:** You will communicate with other users on a regular basis, for this you need to be communicative, mature and civil. Lots of mod decisions are discussed in our backroom subreddit, modmail and discord, so you will need to be able to work well together with the other team members. 
- **Free time:** You don't need to have a ton of time on your hands, but when you get accepted you should have enough time to actually carry out moderating duties. 
- **Thick skin:** history is a subject people often try to use to push their agenda. When they are not allowed to do so they can get rather nasty. 
- **Willingness to install and use third party tools:** This includes browser extensions aimed at mods as found on /r/toolbox which are essential for moderating as well as using applications for chatting with the team on discord. 

Some of the responsibilities include: 

- Review unmoderated links and modqueue reports and remove off topic and rule breaking content.
- Answer subscriber questions in modmail.
- Enforce sidebar rules.

If you have no idea how moderating works on reddit and want to check out more about that first you can have a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/historymod101).

## What do I get in return? 

There is no monetary reward as it is all volunteer work. However you do get a better subreddit in return and a very friendly team work with. 

## Great, how do I apply? 

You can do so [through this link](https://goo.gl/forms/jY5dBCGgwKgaTxID2), we will ask a few questions we will use in the application process. Take the time to answer them. As rule of thumb if all your answers are one line long it is very unlikely that you'll be considered. 

## How long will the applications be open for? 

We are always looking for new moderators so there is no end date as it is an ongoing process.

## Good luck!

My family and I are taking a trip to Turkey later this summer, and in preparation I have been trying to learn more about Turkish/Ottoman history. I'm really interested in history (currently minoring in history), and since Turkey has such a long and rich one, I would love the get the most out of this trip by learning more about the region. I have done a lot of research (both on reddit and other sites) but I've been having a hard time finding good sources, and was hoping people had some suggestions. If it helps, I'm going to Istanbul, Ephesus, and Cappadocia.

While I would love to learn everything about Ottoman history, I'm on a time limit (my trip is in 2 months), so I'm most interested in focusing on things that would be beneficial to know on my trip. I'm thinking I should read/listen to a source that will give me a general survey of Ottoman history. What are the most formidable years that I should focus on (that had the biggest impact on art/culture/etc)?

For books — while I'm open to reading an engaging book, I'm a college student beginning summer break and honestly I'm a bit burnt out from the school year, so I don't want a difficult/strenuous read. I'd really prefer an audiobook, however, if there is a 'classic' must-read history book I would read it. Along those lines, if anyone has a favorite podcast on Turkish/Ottoman history let me know!

For point of clarity, this is not a question about the Eastern/Western and modern Roman/Byzantine distinctions drawn by historians. I understand and am well aware that the Empire as it existed in 1000 AD was radically different (geographically, religiously, linguistically, socially, etc.) than the Empire as it was nearly a thousand years earlier in 100 AD. The focus of my question is therefore a bit more narrow and specifically pertains to the differences between the capitals themselves and life within (during the stated time periods).

Being relatively familiar with the infrastructure of Rome and its various facilities/amenities at the turn of the second century (roads, aqueducts, bath houses, gymnasiums, restaurants, multi-story apartments, stadiums, etc.), it seems like civilian life in the original capital of the empire could have been great, relatively speaking. 

I am less familiar, however, with the infrastructure of its eastern successor, Constantinople, specifically during the medieval period around 1000 AD. In this aspect, and nine-hundred years apart, how do these two cities and respective capitals of the Empire compare?

Was communism more popular or less popular amongst the people of South Vietnam?

Obviously, many South Vietnamese wanted to be independent from North Vietnam and/or opposed communism and we’re willing to fight for it. But was this the opinion of the majority?

From what I’ve read, North Vietnam and South Vietnam weren’t really two countries, but rather two regions of the same country governed separately after the French vacated their colony there. The Geneva Accords, in which peace was brokered between the French and the Viet Minh, separated the two regions, but the separation was meant to be temporary until general elections could secure reunification under a single government. The War began after the President of South Vietnam refused to allow the planned elections and reunification in 1955 causing North Vietnam to seek reunification through force.

The South Vietnamese government’s stated reason for not allowing the elections was that they did not sign the Geneva Accords therefor they didn’t have to follow the accords. But that sounds to me like spurious reasoning from a government that may not have thought it wouldn’t get the mandate of the people if the vote took place.

history,frontovika,0,14,"The Nazis were certainly infamous for looting precious works of art and national treasures from occupied European nations, but I also wonder about the Allies' policy of returning or claiming stolen loot during the aftermath of the war. I've been studying a book, ""Hitler and the Habsburgs"" (2018) by James Longo, and there was a chapter about how members of the royal Habsburg family tried to reclaim family heirlooms hidden by the Nazis and found by the ""Monuments Men"". However they refused to return the items back to the family.

Therefore two questions for your consideration:

- How often were the national treasures of European nations stolen by the Nazis returned to their proper owners at the conclusion of the war by the Allies? I sometimes wonder if liberators with sticky fingers would be inclined to hold onto a few precious mementos? I view the honesty and professionalism of the so-called Monuments Men or artwork liberators with a high degree of skepticism. 

- How about Germany's national treasures and historical artifacts (from the Middle Ages and onwards)? excluding the questionable Nazi stuff. Were they also throughly ransacked and looted by the Allies as well? I'd imagine medieval castles, museums, and other cultural heritage sites would be quite lucrative for looters. I'm sure that even the homes of civilians were up for plunder. 

It goes without saying that the aftermath of the Second World War was a time of terrible suffering and upheaval, especially for civilians. I understand looting and ransacking are often regarded as appealing bounties of war for soldiers, regardless of whether they fought for the Allies or Axis. I understand the Soviets were quite vengeful with their looting in Eastern Germany, especially after the devastation that the Nazis wreaked on their homeland. But not much seems to be said about the Allies.

history,p-one,0,16,"I've been reading ""The Holy Roman Empire"" by Peter Wilson and it's been fascinating. But it's left me with many questions about what things looked like day to day (especially 1000-14000).

For example on p376 he says ""Armed retaliation through feuds remained a legal way to seek redress under imperial law"" but how did this work in practice? Doesn't raising a militia and attacking another count or prince usurp the authority of the emperor's court?

On p374 he says ""The rest [of Thuringia] passed to the Wettin family [...] who managed to repel royal efforts to escheat it as a vacant fief,"" but how does the emperor make the case that it is ""vacant"" in the first place when there is clear inheritance. This is maybe part of my broader confusion of how the transition from imperial appointments to hereditary confirmation was perceived.

At a high level I'm really enjoying this book but throughout when Wilson gives an on-the-ground example of something I'm often struck with ""wait but how do you justify that action"" or ""don't you have the authority to just make that happen?""

Now,  this makes sense in the context of a video game, where you as an  omniscient observer directly give orders to everyone, regardless of  where they are, and the battles are relatively small-scale and fast. For  example, in a video game, it makes sense for cavalry to ""flank the  enemy and charge them from behind"". The issue I have is that I haven't  found references to such tactics in the history books I read.

If  I return to my example regarding the role of cavalry: a book on Roman  history I read describes that roman cavalry was deployed on the wings of  battle lines and would fight other cavalry units. In case they would  wind (which they rarely did, at least in the times of the republic) hey  would harass the enemy flanks, raid the camp or pursue the enemy  cavalry, but never fully envelop the enemy lines. I would love to cite  the book but I haven't been able to find an English translation.

Another  example would be the battle of Agincourt, where there was a small  contingent of men-at-arms attack the English rear, but not to attack  their battle lines, rather to raid the baggage train.

history,mctitties6969,0,3,"I've been doing a lot of research into the Easter Rising, Irish War for Independence,  Civil War, etc, and I still have a LOT to learn, but this is one thing that always troubled me.


So, I know that the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising were generally hated by the public until their executions in their own land by a foreign power, and I feel like the same applied for Collins in 1922 after his execution by his own countrymen. He definitely gained a lot of support from Irish Republicans after Bloody Sunday, his 12 Apostles, giving financial support to the families of fallen rebels, etc., but I know he also made many many enemies both overseas and in Ireland for the same things.


I understand the hatred people had for him and the free-staters after the signing of the treaty in 1922 to let England keep control of the northern counties. Collins was definitely more of a militant leader and didn't mind taking the fight directly to the English, but he seemed to know that the treaty was a necessity to an eventual free Ireland. Meanwhile, De Valera seemed to be less about action, but refused to accept any sort of treaty. This probably made it a very hard decision because putting Collins in charge of the Provisional Government could only further intensify the tension between the two countries: England hated by many Irishmen because of centuries of oppression, and Collins hated by England because the new 'leader' personally gave orders to have dozens of British Soldiers and spies executed and led a military revolt against them. But overall, Collins seemed to go down in history as a hero and martyr to the Irish Republic, whereas De Valera sort of just drifted in and out


Could Michael Collins have gone on to lead the Irish Republic and eventually achieve full Irish Independence through his own methods? Or was his execution needed to put a less militant leader in power and promote future peace talks between the two Nations?

She even with her men but not in a sexual way but more so to be “one of the boys”.  When she was in prison, she was forced to sign a contract that said she would never cross dress again otherwise she would be executed and the male guards took her clothes and said she could either stay naked in front of them or put men’s clothes on and she put the men’s clothes on which prompted her to be executed.

Most polytheists willingly converted, though when Emperor Theodosius made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire, the remaining pagans living in the empire were violently persecuted. While most historians would say this was the final death of the polytheistic religion of Classical Mythology, I've done a bit of searching online and found that it wasn't the case?

history,N0bahdy,0,119,"Bit of a backdrop to this talking point, during the 1400s Venetian and Florentine nobility started writing dancing manuals, which included detailed instructions for the protocol and ceremony male courtiers had to follow while in public. The standards set in these books were considered the norm for noble male behavior. When the merchant and middle classes gained wealth and political influence in the 1500s, nobility felt their status was threatened.

Simultaneously lower nobility and wealthy merchants were debating that noble status was not defined by predefined social standing and family Legacy, but by merit and virtue. Some merchant families were living the lives of nobility, while some nobles in Venice were poor and homeless. 

To secure their power and authority I think nobility published even more specific manuals for male behavior in order to enforce their pious respect towards higher nobility, prevent merchant and middle classes from reaching noble status, and to make sure men in Italy did not go against traditional societal norms in regards to social structure. 

They used works by Erasmus, Castiglione, Caroso, Ebreo, Machiavelli, and other influential noblemen to detail the expectations for social behavior, and the punishments for misbehavior was made worse to the point of complete removal of social status and aid by the 1600s.

I think nobility did this because of the rising power of the merchant class, and the debate among other nobles on the qualifications for noble status.",Did nobility during the Italian Renaissance in the 1500s to 1600s use their power to alter the way the middle and merchant class men behaved?,2019-05-19 01:25:22

&gt;The discovery of Che's remains metonymically activated a series of interlinked associations—rebel, martyr, rogue figure from a picaresque adventure, savior, renegade, extremist—in which there was no fixed divide among them. The current court of opinion places Che on a continuum that teeters between viewing him as a misguided rebel, a coruscatingly brilliant guerrilla philosopher, a poet-warrior jousting at windmills, a brazen warrior who threw down the gauntlet to the bourgeoisie, the object of fervent paeans to his sainthood, or a mass murderer clothed in the guise of an avenging angel whose every action is imbricated in violence—the archetypal Fanatical Terrorist.

Besides go through the chemical formulas for how concrete is made today using Portland cement, I also am hoping to go over the history of the use of concrete starting in 10000 B.C. as well as (maybe) the chemical equations of how Roman concrete and ancient lime mortars were made. As a result, I have a handful of questions about concrete in case anybody knows about them.

1. Did the Romans widely use concrete out of volcanic ash? I have found a source that made me infer it was mostly only used for large projects like the Colosseum, Pantheon, etc,  while the rest of the empire used weak mortar using burned limestone. Simply, I am asking if volcanic ash could be transported hundreds of miles in order to make cement.
2. When a source says a people used a limestone mortar, I have found that means it hydrates Calcium Oxide, just one of the bonding agents in modern cement. Does anybody know the chemical equation for this reaction?  I found that Tricalcium and Dicalcium Silicate (3CaO+SiO2) reacts in modern cement, but limestone only includes CaO and volcanic ash seems to only include SiO2 alongside aluminum and iron. Did the Romans use both to make cement? Is more than just limestone needed to make cement?

In the that podcast Neil at some point is explaining to Joe the affects European colonization had on North/South America, detailing to some extent the devastation European disease brought to the Americas which killed approximately 90% of the Native American population. A scale on which history knows no other. So earlier in the podcast Neil talks about the separation of species ( during the Ice age when people crossed The Bering Land Bridge) and how this was a unique point in history when there were essentially two separate world's who knew nothing of one another. This separation is one if not the single most driving force in the reason why European disease sweeped through The Americas the way it did. Soon after that Neil follows up with how it is a possibly that syphilis might have came from the new world. That's when a very interesting question got into my head. ""Syphilis? That's it? Separated for several thousand years we kill 90% of the population with a whole grab bag of dieses yet what we got from them was ""possibly"" syphilis, how is that possible? The main explanation out there is that Europeans simply had stronger immune systems a product of their environment and daily lifestyles ( larger living communities, Livestock/Cattle ect..) .My problem is native Americans also were known to live in huge communities (Mayans, Aztecs, Incas ect..) although not quite the same as the townships,  ect.. of their western counterparts but still where large groups of people would gather and have contact. I cannot reasonably see how it is possible that i could simply go to another country which i have never been and pick up native diseases and possibly die and spread that diseases  (Malaria, Schistosomiasis, ebola ect) in 2019. Yet at a time where two separate populations of humans are meeting after thousands of years of seperation at a time with much older medicines, the disparities are so drastically different between their effect on us and our effect on them that is seems unreasonable... my theory is what if the disparities weren't as big as we think? What if the worst already came thru. Through history we see many instances factual and debateable when people from the the known world discovered and or migrated to the new world. Yet we see no instances (that I'm aware of) where people from the new world discovered the old..is it not possible, that some events in history could be explained by people accidentally coming from the new world as Columbus did trying to discover india but did not have the means, intentions, knowledge or effect to have made it into the history books, similar to what Leif Erickson did unaware of the significance of their discovery.

I read an article today about how the the bubonic plague has been traced to have originated from Asia based on dna testing https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206309.php. it's funny how I read this today considering in the podcast Neil DeGrasse  mentions how the people crossing The Bering Land Bridge were more than likely people of Asian decent and when the bridge went back up they could only mix with there own genes. So if they populated the Americas their off spring would be of Asian decent all the way until colonization of the americas, although not retaining only Asian features do to micro evolution (Darwanism) after thousands of years in a different enviorment. Now for my question would it not be possible for something like the emergence of The Black Plague to be caused by one person or a group of people going to ""The Old World""?

history,Meowts,0,1,"Here's a multi-layered questions from a non-historian but someone who's interested to know more.

I was just reading an article on homosexuality in history (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/), and something that struck me was how ideas and quotes from past philosophers managed to have an influence on their current politics, and can still be used to defend ideas or positions. A recurring theme in this article is the idea that a ""truth"" is told, and remains the ""truth"" without exceptions (despite science) - and if you're an exception, the governing body will help ease the confusion by making it not exist anymore, at times more so strictly than others.

Part of what I'm wondering is if in those times, it wasn't just ""Man has real good thought, let's follow"", rather more of an ecosystem of interests that helped influence policy and develop ""society"", and if this is talked about in different contexts of history (or perhaps about relationships between the thinkers and the policy makers).

Back to the gays, I'm wondering if things like spreading illness (no disposable, flushable anything at any time before 100-200 years ago?), or personal insecurities (anything non consensual sucks, probably happened a lot, still does, still sucks), or lack of availability to proper lubricants (""unnatural"" indeed if it hurts) had any influence on the minds of policy makers and followers / enforcers, and if it has been written about (I suppose people didn't write much about swollen anuses, but did they?).

But in real life whenever I see this (on reenactors and cosplayers) their masks tend to be very loose and wag and wave all over the place when they move and fight, and the chains are so loose and see through you can clearly see their entire face underneath the mail.

So are these badly made loose re-enactor masks or is that actually how those masks looked and functioned in real life.

I’m asking because personally I think it looks really lame when it’s all loose and seethrough and looks incredibly terrifying and badass when it’s 0% see through and you can’t see anything but the persons eyes, and the mask is tight on their face and now waving all around and moving all around, and flipping and folding upwards whenever they move or fight in it.

Recently, I’ve been reading Toby Wilkinson’s *The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt*, and it’s got me again questioning how much the kings of ancient Egypt really believed in their religion.

Here’s why I find it kind of confusing. On one hand, the kings of Egypt were deeply focused on the afterlife; during their reigns, they always spent a great deal of effort on having elaborate burial chambers constructed to ensure them a comfortable afterlife, so it seems to me that they must have truly believed that they would one day be reborn in the Field of Reeds.

On the other hand, the kings also made up Horus names for themselves that denoted their power, and the connection between the pharaohs and the gods seems to have waffled between “favored by the gods” to “physical manifestation of a god.” The reasoning behind these titles, and much of the ceremony surrounding the pharaohs, could have been a result of genuine religious devotion, but it seems like the end goal was always to ensure dominion and exercise power.

history,Real_Carl_Ramirez,0,6,"**Disclaimer**: I am not trying to promote or denigrate any sport here. I don't actually follow any sport closely. 

I am a citizen and resident of Australia, a former British colony. The most popular sports in Australia are swimming, surfing, cricket and ""football"" sports (i.e. Rugby League, Rugby Union and Australian Rules Football). However, soccer is only modestly (but increasingly) popular in Australia, despite our coloniser, the UK, being very much into soccer. After all, if cricket took root in Australia due to British colonisation, why not also soccer?:

* How come soccer didn't take root very much in other British colonies such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India?

* How come soccer did take root in South Africa, another former British colony, especially among indigenous South Africans? 

* How come soccer is more popular than cricket in the former British colonies of Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore?

The reason I ask this question is because I have spent the last 7 weeks travelling around South America, and all the countries I have visited (namely Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile) are very much into soccer. I am not surprised, considering that the colonisers of South America, Spain and Portugal, are also very much into soccer.

I was born in the Philippines, a former Spanish colony in Southeast Asia, but somehow, soccer failed become popular there. 

* Instead, the most popular sports in the Philippines are boxing and basketball.

* Basketball was spread by the Americans (or what Latin Americans call ""Estado Unidense"") when the Philippines was their colony, so is American influence the reason why soccer failed to become popular in the Philippines? 

* I doubt that the low level of Iberian immigration to the Philippines (at least compared to Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil) was the reason why soccer failed to become popular there, because soccer did become popular in the majority-indigenous nations of Peru and Bolivia. 

Speaking of sports spread by the Spanish, how come bullfighting:

* Did catch on in Mexico (I know Mexico's not in South America, but my dad has watched bullfighting there in 2008), Peru and Colombia.

* But did not catch on in the Philippines, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile?:

* It seems especially odd that bullfighting didn't catch on in Argentina and Uruguay, considering their abundance of cattle.

* I doubt that animal rights concerns were the main reason why bullfighting didn't catch on in Argentina and Uruguay. 

Finally, how does climate influence the popularity of sports?:

* For example, I know that the popularity of swimming and surfing in Australia is influenced by our hot climate and our population being concentrated around the coasts.

* So how come soccer can be popular from the taiga climates of Northern Europe, to the Mediterranean, to the Amazon Rainforest, to the Argentine Pampa, to the Bolivian Altiplano, to the Atacama Desert?

* Considering that soccer caught on in the Philippines' neighbours such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia (a former Dutch colony), I doubt that climate was what prevented soccer from catching on in the Philippines.",What factors influenced the spread of sports by colonial powers?,2019-05-16 00:29:54

Never posted here before and I did scroll through this sub's recommended reading list, but I'd like to know any or YOUR personal favorites in the aforementioned medias that held your attention. Also I'm on Reddit strictly mobile and though I think the reading list here was a great resource, it became a slog to scroll through.

Basically, to anyone willing to help me out, I'm going through a history hunger phase again. I love Dan Carlin's Hardcore History like a lot of people, but a lot of his stuff is only available for purchase now. So to start, which of his series are worth buying? Or which are your favorites? I got Wrath of the Khans of course, was curious what people thought of Apache Tears as that's one I'm considering.

Would love something engaging on the history of the Aztecs as well! Rome, histories of Northmen, Celts, etc. What do you guys love? What series or book did you come back to twice or three times because it was so good? I just miss the old history channel and was hoping you all might have something that can satisfy my cravings.

history,VideoGrimes,0,4,"I like food, I like the history of food, lets make this fun!

My contribution:

I know that Iced Sweet Tea here in the Southern United States was exactly that in the 18th and 19th century. Before the invention of modern refrigeration Ice had to be gathered from frozen lakes and shipped across the world, and lots of product would melt before reaching to its destination.

White sugar was the most expensive and most refined end product of cane sugar manufacturing. Lots of slave labor was used in the production of cane sugar, and the human cost and suffering was immense and horrible.

And finally Tea, an already fancy drink. Here in the South we drink black tea, which lots of it was imported.

So sitting on a large slave plantation, sipping from a tall glass of Sweet Iced Tea was not only refreshing for the upper-class, but a symbol of their wealth and power.

(As a proud Southerner, I'm glad that I can enjoy my sweet tea humanely now-a-days, with a little research into humane products) #ScrewTheConfederacy

 I have tried researching but couldn’t find anything other than that the discovery of mountain roots came long after these scriptures talked about them. The reason I ask is because someone was discussing how this could have only been divinely inspired, but from a non-religious point of view, it makes no sense that people would talk about mountain roots if they didn’t know since they could only see the top part on the ground, and not what’s beneath
 
So I want to know, when was this first talked about in history?

Edit: if it’s not clear enough lm asking if there is any text recorded in history that talks about or mentions roots of the mountains -doesn’t have to be the first- and is older than 3 thousand years

history,Briennetarthhhhhh,0,13,"Looking at the world history, Egyptians, Persians, Chinese etc, authoritarian governments seem to be the norm, while democracy is more like a rare mutation.

I don’t think the ancient Greek philosophy of “living a virtuous life”, “rule by many” just happened randomly, but I don’t have much knowledge of how the Greek lived and what are the social factors that might contribute to democracy. 

In general the west seems to be more aware of the legitimacy of the government than the their eastern neighbors, England had the Magna Carta long before the Enlightenment, France and Netherlands had the revolution, Scandinavian countries are closer to “socialism” than any country in the world who claim themselves to be. 


My theory is that this has a lot to do with the population. 

The east was much more populated in general, think about China and India, in a place where there are more people than available resources, competition becomes fierce. People need to “step over” others to get the resource they need, they can only do so by violence. Ruling by fear is the only working way, otherwise it will be in chaos. 

Democracy is a social contract that seems to be much more acceptable in a situation where resources are abundant with people had their basic needs fulfilled. It also seems to be more likely to happen in an isolated, peaceful place where war is not a huge threat. 

When there is less people it also make lives more valuable. The enlightenment thinking emphasizes greatly on “human nature”, I doubt in a overly populated, highly competitive society it will be possible to have the same respect for “human rights”. 

But then I was thinking, is it true that agrarian civilization tends to be more populated? Why Europe was never as populated as the east? 

It will be great to hear some insights from people who have researched on Ancient Greece or European history. I’ll be glad to hear any arguments on this theory and you are welcome to come up with other possible factors/theories. 
It will also be great if you have any recommendations on books regarding this.",Was it a coincidence that democracy emerged in ancient Greece? What might be the factors that contribute to it?,2019-05-11 08:58:12
